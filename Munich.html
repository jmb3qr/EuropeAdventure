<h1> July 14th </h1>
<a id="July14"></a>

<p> Once again we had to wake up early to make our train. We got a taxi back to the train station and grabbed gramps some McDonald's. We got to Munich around 10 and walked straight to our Air bnb. The owner greeted us at the door and showed is around. I was ecstatic to finally do laundry after two weeks....  After I put my laundry in we set out for the day. Gramps wanted to go to the airport to make sure that he had assistance on the flight home. Our train was delayed so it took us an hour and a half to get to the airport. Once we were there the delta lady told us it was all taken care of, so we had just wasted a couple of hours. </p>

<p> From the airport we headed to Dachau. It took us a little over an hour to get there because we had to take 2 different trains and a bus. Dachau was one of the first and largest concentration camps in Germany. It is about 20 minutes outside of Munich and it was the camp where all of the "worst" people were sent. There were 400 working camps around Munich and then 12 concentration camps. If you misbehaved at a work camp you were sent to a concentration camp, if you misbehaved at a concentration camp you were sent to Dachau. Dachau was built to house 6,000 people but when it was liberated in 1945 there were 32,000 people staying there. </p>

<p> There was an incredible museum that taught me more about World War I and II in an hour than I learned in any history book. It also helped having grandpa tell me little tid bits of left out information along the way. We toured the barracks, the chapels, and the crematories. We meet a group of 4 kids from Vancouver who were extremely nice, it was a sister, 2 brothers, and their cousin on a euro trip together. We talked to them for a long time and they were really interested in listening to grandpa’s stories. </p>

<p> We headed back to Munich and picked up some maps from the tourist information center. We went to a beer garden for dinner that was delicious. I got a beer and an assortment of sausages with sour kraut. Grandpa was able to indulge in an alcohol free beer. Once again we say and talked for about two hours about everything. </p>

<p>After dinner we got a taxi back to our apartment and grandpa was sure to time that it was 8 minutes. </p>

<p> Gramps is really into numbers especially when he can use numbers to prove you wrong. Every time I tell him how far something is away he calculates it in his head so that when we get there he can tell me, your wrong, it wasn't .4 miles it was .46789 miles.... I usually tell him to he is a smart ass and that we made it regardless of the extra 100 steps. </p>

<p> We both slept like rocks but at 7:45 grandpa woke me up. We ended up lying in bed till about 9:30 and then finally rallied to get moving. Grandpa had to stop for his Burger King breakfast and he's learned that if he buys me Starbucks then he gets to sit while I drink it. After both of our tummies were satisfied we headed for the hop on hop off bus. To continue the tradition we rode it all around the center city and looked where everything was and listened to the lady talk. Once the bus tour was over we got on a tram and went to Alter Botanischer Garden and then to the Konigsplatz Squre. </p>

<p>We walked to the Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism. This museum opened in May so it is still free to visitors. It was an amazing museum covering all of the information from 1913-1947. Everything in the museum is in chronological order so it is really nice to get your history and facts all in order. Once again grandpa would call me over to point out different small things I would have never noticed. </p>

<p> We walked to the modern art museum and put gramps in a wheel chair so I could whip him around the museum. This museum was honestly not very impressive, there was only 1 exhibit that really caught my eye. It was an exhibit on creating realities and used different lighting techniques to alter shadows. Gramps also got a kick of all the modern art with naked people. </p>

<p> We walked to get on the metro to take it to the city center. We walked around the Marienplatz square, which is home to the New Town hall. </p>

<p> After WW II almost every building in the city had been leveled. In order to preserve history Munich tried their absolute best to re-create every single building as it had once been. We walked to the Viktualienmarkt and enjoyed a sausage. In the middle of this market is a beer garden that sits 1,000 people so we enjoyed a beer while we were there. </p>

<Gramps was stationed in Erding Germany twice which is about 30 minutes outside of Munich. He wanted to visit so we hoped on a train and went out to Erding for the evening. On the train we learned that the base had not been an airbase in about 15 years and that they were in the final stages of closing it completely. He wanted to walk into the town center and look at the towers and steeples that he remembered. He was so excited to be back to place that he remembered so well. We sat in a beer garden in the center of town and enjoyed dinner. I learned that Erdinger is one of the biggest breweries in Germany that people come from all over the world to visit the brewery. After dinner we hopped back on a train and headed towards our apartment. </p>
