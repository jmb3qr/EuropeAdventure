<h1> July 1st </h1>
<a id="July1"></a>

	<p>I had a long long day! I woke up at 7 and walked 20 minutes to the bus station at Vence. I took an hour and a half long bus ride to Nice. I walked 30 minute from the bus stop in Nice to the train station. I took a six hour train from Nice to Geneva, Switzerland. I took another train from Geneva to Bern and then another train from Bern to Interlaken. The view of all the lakes and mountains was absolutely beautiful!</p>

	 <p>I finally got to Interlaken at 8:30 and took a bus to my hostel in Interlaken. I couldn’t get a room in the hostel me and Kelsey are staying at so I am staying in a tent hostel for the next 2 days before Kelsey gets here. The hostel I am staying at is so cool! It’s an outdoor tent hostel surrounded by the Swiss Alps. The weather here is perfect, I got to my hostel right at sunset and got to watch the sky turn pink around all of the mountains. </p>



<h1> July 2nd </h1>
<a id="July1"></a>

	<p> The weather is really nice, its hot in the day and cool at night, this is perfect because we are sleeping in tents and it would be miserable if it was hot all night. However, as soon as the sun comes up the tent heats up. This is nice because it makes everyone awake bright and early. By 7am the hostel is lively and everyone is getting ready for their days adventures. This morning I woke up, showered, and then went to the grocery to buy stuff for breakfast and lunch. After I got food I took a bus to the Wilderswill train station and then took a train up a little higher on the mountain to Lauterbrunnen. Lauterbrunnen is a very cute down in the valley between two huge mountains. </p>

	<p>From this train station I went on a four hour hike to Winteregg and back down. For the first hour I was pretty sketched out because I did not see a single other person, but then I got to the popular part and saw tons of people!  One nice thing about this hike compared to the ones I did in Norway is that the trails were really well marked. </p>

	<p> Speaking of Norway, check out this video!</p>

	<p>The hike was absolutely beautiful! And pretty challenging, I climbed 800 meters from 800 meters to 1600 meters. I took my time on this journey and really enjoyed the scenery. The view on one side was of the highest peaks in Europe, Monch and Jungfrau. </p>

	<p> Everything was so green and perfect! I wanted to take pictures of it all! </p>

	<p> On the walk down I was trying to find a nice place to eat lunch. I ended up coming across a lean too of some sort that had a perfect bench and view. </p>

	<p>On the mountain there were a ton of maintained buildings that were empty and I’m not really sure what they are for. It might be some sort of skiing shelter for the winter. Most of these buildings have carvings all over the inside and this building had something perfect carved for me!</p>

	<p> During the entire hike I was so hot that every time I saw any runoff I poured it all over my face. The melting snow makes the water so refreshing! I also stumbled upon a waterfall and sat and read my book for a while. </p>

	<p> On the train ride back down after the hike I feel asleep, I got back to my hostel and laid on a lounge chair until I had the energy to get up. I walked into town and walked up and down every street. On the way back I grabbed some groceries for dinner and cooked. I have gotten pretty good at making 3 dollar halfway decent meals. After sweating all day I finally took an ice cold shower. My hostel is very social but for some reason I have been keeping to myself. I have really been enjoying the alone time. At night I have gotten to sit in a hammock chair and watch the sunset while I write my blog, it has been really nice. </p>

<h1>July 3rd </h1>
<a id="July3"></a>

	<p>I woke up and packed up all of my things because me and Kelsey were staying in a different hostel the next two nights. At 11:30 I got picked up by Bumble Bee Hang Gliding! Needless to say it was AWESOME!!! They took me and another guy up to the top of a mountain and we ran off it and flew for about 12 minutes. It was so so cool and my guide was awesome! I wasn’t scared at all, I was just so so so happy! I don’t think I stopped smiling the whole time I was up there!</p>

	<p>After I got back to the hostel I grabbed my things and walked to the new hostel. I sat down and had lunch. Bumble bee had given me a voucher for a free beer so I went and got that. Then I got on a bus and went to a public beach on the lake for the afternoon. The view was beautiful and I slept and read all afternoon.</p>

	<p> I got a bus back around 7 and cooked dinner and waited for KBOW to get here! Her train got in at 10 and I went to the train station to meet her. </p>




<h1> July 4th </h1>
<a id="July4"></a>

	<p>In the morning we went canyoning, we did the lowest level canyon but it was still awesome! We started by walking through the river and then did some natural slides. We repelled off a 30 foot cliff and into the water below. We did some pretty big jumps and had to jump in a certain area to avoid the rocks. </p>

	<p>Our 2 guides were really cool, the girl went to University of Michigan and studied industrial engineering. When she finished she got a real job and after a year realized she hated it and moved to Interlaken. She has been working there for 5 years know and also does logistical work for a tourism company. Interlaken is supposed to be a really happy chill environment so after the canyoning they gave us a beer and hung out with us. </p>

	<p> We went to a nearby cafe for lunch and then decided we wanted to rent bikes for the rest of the day. It was one of the best decisions we made! We biked around the Brienzer lake and when we got hot we stopped to swim. We found this one area with a lot of people and decided to hang out. We made friends with some locals and talked to them about their lives.

	<p>Two of the people had Olympic ring tattoos and were on the Switzerland curling team in the last Olympics. There was one guy who was super nice and talked to us for a really long time. </p>

	<p>After about 2 hours we got up and rode our bikes a little bit more and then returned them. </p>

	<p>The hostel we were staying at makes a big deal out of Fourth of July so there were good happy hours all evening.</p>

	<p> Me and kbow bellied up to the bar and made some friends. The bar tender was a local girl who was studying in Scotland, but she wasn't super friendly. We made friends with two guys from Australia and then a bunch of girls from San Diego State. It was over 100 degrees so after being out all day we took ice cold showers. Balmers takes a hostel group picture every year on the Fourth of July so we got front and center of that. </p>

	<p>Balmers is known for being the cool young hip hostel however in the past few years the environment has kinda changed. Interlaken has started to be taken over by Asians and they are not there to have fun. They come and just sit in the hostel all day and go to bed early. We were kinda sad to see this because we wanted to meet cool people and hang out. All the local guides come to celebrate as well and after they put together an obstacle course and people compete to win a 2 for 1 rafting or canyoning. For the race you had to put on a life jacket and helmet, bob for an apple, stick your face in a bowl of flower, crawl under chairs, slip n slide down a flipped over raft, ride a mini bike, and then do a beer bong. I came in second so I got an outdoor Interlaken T-shirt. <\p>

<p></p>

	<p>Switzerland has a 10pm mandatory quite time so the party had to move to the club downstairs. The guides invited us to go with them to a local party so we decided to go. Two guys handle bard us to the pool the party was at. This was a giant public pool with a really big yard. They put a stage in the yard part and had a reggae band playing while everyone sat in a circle talking. The guides had invited all the cool people they meet in the day so there was a little mix of tourist. I got to talk more to the guy who took me hang gliding and he was super super nice. One of the guys that handle bard us had just moved to Switzerland from Africa. He is originally from Zimbabwe but a couple of years ago the government kicked out everyone that was white. He said they came, took their farm animals, took their land, and burned all of their buildings and his family had to flee. He moved to Uganda and became a raft guide there. One of the owners of Outdoor Interlaken us from Zimbabwe so he told this guy he would give him a job for the summer. At 11 they switch from a reggae band to a DJ and everyone stood up and started to circulate. We knew we had to be up early to travel so we walked back pretty early and went to bed. </p>
