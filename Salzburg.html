<h1> July 13th </h1>
<a id="July13"></a>


	<p>We had to wake up around 5:45 to get the train station in time. I highly underestimated the time it would take in the morning so we ended up missing the train we were trying for. Throughout the entire trip every time we've missed something gramps says, Well I guess we will just take the next one! I have had to learn on this trip to not have a time table by any means. If we are going to miss something I just keep my mouth shut and let us miss it. </p>

	<p> The train ride was about 2 hours and when we got to Salzburg we hung out in a Starbucks for a while. Gramps wanted to get a taxi to our air bnb so we got a taxi. After we dropped our stuff of we went to explore the town. We started by walking through the St. Andrews church and then through the Mirabell gardens. </p>

	<p> We got on grandpas favorite hop on hop off bus and took it all around the city. Once we had driven all around we got off in the old town to more thoroughly explore. We grabbed lunch and then took the funicular up to the old fortress. The fortress had amazing views from the top. </p>

	<p> The fortress was massive and the inside was as big as a city itself. We walked around the entire thing and then rode back down. We walked through the old town city center and went inside the Dom Cathedral.</p>

	<p> We decided that we were tired and went back to our apartment to take a nap. When we woke up from our nap we walked into the old town and found a place for dinner. Dinners are my favorite part of the day because me and grandpa just talk for an hour or two. During the day he is concerned with how far were walking, what we're doing, or how many steps we we've walked up, but during dinner he is worried about nothing. We ate at a nice Italian place and on the walk home got some Gelato. I got Nutella flavored and I told gramps that it was the best dollar he had ever spent. </p>

	<p> At night I google hung out with all of my friends. After being away for an entire month I am really missing them. </p>
