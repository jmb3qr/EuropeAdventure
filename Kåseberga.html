	<p> We rode on a bus to a historical site in the South East of Sweden, this site is known as the Swedish Stonehenge called Ales Stenar ("Ale's Stones"). We had a tour guide that showed us around the village and historical site. </p>

	<p>Ancient Scandinavians dragged 59 boulders to a seaside cliff near what is now the Swedish fishing village of Kåseberga. These stones each weigh up to 4,000 pounds and they are oriented in the outline of a 220-foot-long ship overlooking the Baltic Sea. There is a large debate over when/why these rocks were constructed, people argue that they were put there any time from 1,400 years ago to 2,500 years ago. Some say that ancient traders saw Stonehenge and how it was used as an astronomical calendar and built this as a copy of Stonehenge. Others argue that this was constructed as a Burial site.

	<p>Ales Stenar is placed on a plateau that looks over the sea. Sheep are free roaming on top of this, and paragliders use this to run off of. </p>

	<p>We had a traditional lunch in the village that was composed of mashed potatoes, herring, and lingonberries. </p>

	<p>After lunch we drove to this sustainable community called ecotopia. Ecotopia is a flash back to 100 years ago. A lady runs this farm and they live off the land almost 100 percent. They build all of their own buildings out of bricks that they make from mud, clay, and straw. They make all of their own insulation out of hay, used newspaper, or hemp. They make the foundation of the house out of glass that they dig up from their farm. She also taught us that you can make your own paint for walls out of 30 eggs and distilled water. This is an example of a house that one of the master sustainable builder guided one of the groups of students to build. </p>

	<p>All of the furniture and doors were recycled items from thrift stores. One of the coolest design thing they did was using recycled crown molding to decorate the doors. </p>

	<p> Although all of these buildings are build in sustainable ways they are still beutifull. This is a building that the use for big group gatherings. Before planting the summer crop, they store all of the plants in front of the windows. </p>

	<p>The lady that ran this place wasnt overly impressed with us. While she was trying to show us something every was more interested in the goats with giant horns. She would make snide comments about how american we acted. In Sweden they drink a lot of coffee and there coffeee break in the middle of the day is called fika. The lady was very upset with us becasue we were tired of the presentation and ready for our fika. She picked a bad piece of land in the Sweden country side to prove that every person could live off the land. This farm is a place where people come from all over to learn about sustainable practices such as learning the land, building, farming, and raising livestock. It was pretty cool but that lady was kind of weird and treated us like we were dumb Americans. If you are interested in this place or idea <a href="http://www.ecotopia.se/en/about-ecotopia/">here is her webpage</a>. After these two places we drove the 45 minutes back to dorm and enjoyed the countryside. We were all exhausted and so we laid low for the night, made dinner, and talked around a table all night. </p>
