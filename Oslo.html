<h1> May 30th </h1>
<a id="May30"></a>



	<p>Sunday morning I had a flight from Copenhagen to Oslo at 9:20 am. I needed to wake up, take bus from my dorm, and then 

take a train from Lund to Copenhagen airport. I set my alarm for 6 am to insure that I had enough time. I slept through that alarm 

and frantically sprung out of bed at 7:10. I had missed the bus so I had to get on a city bike with all of my luggage and ride as 

fast as I could to the train station. I got there in 6 minutes but had just missed the 7:16 train. I had to wait for the 7:41 train. 

I got on the 7:41 train and then the guy came around to check tickets. I showed him my ticket and then he tried to charge me a 100 

dollar fine because my ticket wasn’t valid. When I bought my ticket my transaction on my card didn’t work, but I had no idea because 

it was in Swedish. Luckily I still had my card from my class that was good for the entire Skåne region. I didn’t have to pay the 100 

dollar fine but he kicked me off the train. At the next stop I had to get off and go buy another ticket to Copenhagen, and I had to 

get on the 8:13 train to the airport. I got to the airport and ran to find The Norwegian Air Shuttle desk to check my bag. I got to 

my gate at 8:55 and boarded the flight at 9:00…. It was way too close for comfort. </p>

	<p>I arrived in Oslo at 10:30 in the morning and was so beyond excited to see my two best friends!!! </p>

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p> We went back to Kajas house and her and Emilie made my breakfast then we took a 4 hour nap. </p>

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>When we woke up we took a nice long walk in the forest behind Kajas house and then we had dinner. Saturday night we went 

into Oslo and stayed at Kajas sisters house. Me, Emilie, and Kaja hung out and had wine and cheese. Later that night we meet a bunch 

of Kajas guy friends at a bar. They were all really nice to me and I was happy to meet all of them. After the bar we went to a kabob 

place for food and then back to one of their houses. At their house we drank Captain Morgan and watched an NHL playoff game (That 

could only be more American if it was Jack Daniels). </p>
 


<h1>May 31st </h1>
<a id="May31"></a>

	<p>We babysat Kajas nephew all day and took him to a festival called Miniøya. This is like a giant children’s festival in a 

park in Oslo. They had a big stage and there were people playing live music all day. After we were done babysitting Martin we went 

back to Kajas for dinner. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/uh0blgoqljh5bcx/phpPV3AbxPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>After dinner me and Kaja went over to one of Kajas friends, Benedikte’s, house. In Norway it is much more common for a 

group of 20 year old girls to all sit around candles and have light snacks while they talk for hours. It was a lot different then 

what I am used to but it was so quant and enjoyable. All of the girls were so nice and it was so fun to talk to them. Benedikte was 

a foreign exchange student in Australia at the same time Emilie lived with me and her host sister, Ellie, is also in Norway 

visiting. Me and Ellie were talking about traveling and figured out that I might meet up with her and her brother and sister at the 

end of July to backpack. We stayed at Benedikte’s pretty late and then went to bed. </p>

  
  
<h1>June 1st </h1>
<a id="June1"></a>


	<p>Kaja had physical therapy in the morning so I got to be super slow and take multiple hours getting ready and relaxing. I 

woke up, worked out, and ate breakfast. I took a bus into Oslo to meet her and was supposed to get on the bus and take it till the 

last stop. As soon as I got on the bus I feel asleep, I woke up and there were a lot of buses around me and no one on the bus so I 

got off half asleep. As soon as I stepped off I realized I wasn’t in the right place. I walked till I found a 7-11 with wifi and 

messaged kaja to tell her I was lost. She gave me directions to get to here. </p>
	
	<p>At the central station I meet Kaja and Ellie and we started to walk around Oslo. We went in the Oslo Cathedral and the 

organ was absolutely beautiful!</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/3wzcdmbximosx7q/Photo%20Jun%2001%2C%202%2034%2005%20PM.jpg?dl=0"

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rlr1qyx7h2go3q9/phpmShFH6PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p> After that we walked down Karl Johan Street which is the main shopping street in Oslo. </p>
		
		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bsvbbv5p9oingl2/phpR0heM6PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	 <p>This street leads to the Royal Palace and we walked around the palace and in the park around it. </p>
		
		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1wiosr6k7v5e3u4/phpCLHuDZPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>Then we walked to the harbor which they have rebuilt as a sustainable modern community. It was a lot like the Western 

Harbour in Malmö.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/88res8mhmkao2qt/phpCMEBciPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p> After the harbor we went home, we walked to a metro station, took the metro to a bus station, took the bus to another 

station, and Kajas mom picked us up…. Gotta love Scandinavia. </p>

	<p>Earlier in the afternoon one of my friends from Uva texted me and was like, “hey where are you?” I said, “Oslo you should 

come.” So she bought a ticket for later that night from Paris to Oslo. A few hours later she was in Oslo with us. We picked Meghan 

up from the bus stop at 11 and came home to get some rest.</p>

  
  
<h1>June 2nd </h1>
<a id="June2"></a>


	<p>We woke up worked out and took our time getting ready. At noon me, Kaja, and Meghan meet Emilie in the city and went to 

the Norwegian museum of Science and Technology. We had to do inside activities because it was so rainy and cold outside. We were all 

expecting the museum to be kind of boring and childish but we were wrong, it was awesome. It had the whole history of music, 

computers, phones, cars, planes, hospitals and then also had a really cool part about science.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/roojow8522ro4bt/php2oV0tHPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 
 
	<p>We were all very interested in all of the different things. One of the coolest parts was looking at the different 

skeleton pieces and organs they had. They had a placenta with a pre mature baby in it that you could see the baby’s fingers and 

toes! After the museum we went to the mall to pick up a few things and then headed home for dinner and a relaxing night. On the way 

home we stopped at the church where Kajas grandpa is buried. This church looks over the valley and is beautiful.</p>

<h1>June 3rd </h1>
<a id="June3"></a>


	<p>This morning we got a very early start and took a bus into town and bought an Oslo pass. The Oslo pass is 20 dollars a 

day for unlimited transportation and admission to any museum in Oslo. The first place we went to was the Opera house, which is very 

modern and located on the water. </p> 

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/m9vec2425gkvdqj/Photo%20Jun%2003%2C%2010%2048%2008%20PM.jpg?dl=0" 

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>Next we walked to The Akershus which was a castle/fortress that was built to look over the harbor in the late 1290s. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/w6xi9gbd6bs66y4/php3Y2ccWPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>This castle was very important because whoever controlled the castle controlled Norway. The fortress survived countless 

attacks mostly from Sweden but was never successfully taken over. In 1940 Norway surrendered the fortress to Nazi Germany and on May 

11th 1945 Akershus was freed. We went in a museum in the fortress that showcased different kings that lived in the fortress. Inside 

the fortress there is a chapel and it’s where Kaja was christened. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/x9wd75zvydjb5x9/phpux8rRNPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>After the fortress we took the ferry over to the Bygdøy, which is a very rich part of Oslo. We walked to the Norwegian 

Folk Museum which tries to simulate a walk through the past of Norway. The museum has picked up old buildings from all over Norway 

and moved them to one park. This allows you to walk through the park and experience what it would be like to travel to all the 

different regions in Norway. One of the coolest buildings was one of the mid-evil wooden churches called a stave church. There were 

2,000 of these churches built across Norway and only 28 of them are still standing. </p>

height="400">

	<p>Next we went to the Viking museum which had Viking boats that dated back to 890.  The Vikings sailed all over the world 

and conquered different areas. They were able to take over these places because their boats were very shallow so they could get all 

the way into port. It is also said that when the Vikings went into cities they stole all of the pretty girls and took them back to 

Norway. </p>

		<img src="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/files/2013/11/weird-things-people-buried-with-s2048x1399-p.jpg" 

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>After the Viking museum we went to the Kon-Tiki museum which tells the story of Thor Heyerdahl. When Thor was 22 he 

traveled Marquesas Islands to study zoology and biology. While there he noticed all of the similarities between there and South 

America. At this time it was believed that the Marquesas Islands were settled by Europeans. He made it is life goal to prove this 

theory wrong. There is a myth about the Incan sun god, Kon-Tiki, that states that he sailed off into the sea on a raft made of balsa 

trees and was never heard from again. Thor built a raft of balsa trees and proved that you could sail from South America to Tuamotu 

Islands. He took 5 other people with him and it took them 101 days to complete the journey. </p>

height="400">

	<p>After he proved this wrong he started doing archeology in Easter Islands. He then built a ship out of reeds and sailed 

from morocco to Barbados. In all of these adventures he was told his journey was impossible and he proved science and history wrong. 

</p>

	<p>Next we traveled to the Vigeland Sculpture Park in Oslo. This is a giant green space in Oslo, and in the middle of the 

park is a lot of sculptures of naked people. We had a picnic of wine, crackers, and brie in the park and then went to enjoy the 

statues. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hzv0n2ct4dvj4ve/php6BLBknPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>These sculptures were all designed by Vigeland and are supposed to tell a story about humanity. We all kind of thought 

the sculptures were really weird and took pictures with them in funny ways. </p>

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>We spent 12 hours in Oslo being tourist and at the end of the day were exhausted. </p>

  
  
<h1>June 4th </h1>
<a id="June4"></a>

	<p>This morning we started by meeting Kajas mom for brunch at a restaurant that looks over the city of Oslo. This is a 

traditional restaurant that a lot of people go to for weekend brunch. Kajas mom pointed out to us that the table next to us was 15 

of the richest men in Norway. Apparently that group of men eat there every weekend and own 80 percent of Oslo. </p>

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 
	
	<p>After Brunch we went to Holmenkollbakken which is the world champion ski jump. </p>

	<P>We went to the top of Holmenkollbakken which has a view of the entire city and then went in the ski museum under it. </p>
	
		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tn4ijdgy7ahownu/phpCHTzLaPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 
	
	<p>After the jump we took the bus to a street in Oslo that has a bunch of second hand stores. We shopped for a while and I 

got a very cute Old Dooney and Bourke purse. After shopping we worked our way to a contemporary art museum at the harbor. This 

museum was way over our heads once again… we did more playing than we did looking at the art. Most of the pieces looked like this…

</p>

	<p>This was the only cool thing in the entire museum. </p>

<h1>June 5th</h1>
<a id="June5"></a>


	<p>Kaja had to run errands and go to doctors appointments all day so I relaxed and slept in. I went for a 2 hour run in the 

forest behind her house, the trail I wanted to run was around two lakes. She gave me directions which consisted of, "go left and 

when you get to a road, go left,and take your first right".... Let's just say the directions were not bullet proof... She 

underestimated how many times the trail splits. I had to stop a lot and walk to figure out if the trail I was running on was going 

where I wanted to go.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/esix8vyh85haivx/Photo%20Jun%2005%2C%2011%2043%2000%20AM.jpg?dl=0" 

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>In Norway they emphasize being outside and enjoying nature, so much so, that they have outdoor kindergartens. These 

little kids stay outside all year long even when it is negative degrees outside.. I ran past an out door kindergarten enjoying 

playing by the lake.</p>

	<p>After my run I was still feeling like being active so I decided I would walk to the store from Kajas to buy the 

ingredients for baked Brie. I got lost, so the trip took me twice as long but I made it home. Kajas family was having a cook out 

that night for Kajas brothers 21st birthday. I made the baked Brie as an appetizer for the cook out. Kajas uncles, aunts, brothers, 

and sisters all came over and we had hot dogs, opened presents, and ate cake. That night my roommate Kelsey flew into Oslo from 

Copenhagen! We went to pick her up and then went over to benidictas house to celebrate hers and camillas birthday. It was really 

interesting to notice the similarities and differences between parties in America and in Norway and it was absolutely perfect to 

have my four best friends in the world all together for the first time!!!</p>

<h1>June 6th </h1>
<a id="June6"></a>


	<p>We woke up relatively early and me and Kelsey took a walk through the forest to a famous cinnamon bun place. We got all 

the way there and they didn't take american cards, thankfully the guy allowed us to write an IOU for kaja to pay next time she 

went.</p> 

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ybz83g69bukv3kl/Photo%20Jun%2013%2C%2012%2027%2016%20AM.png?dl=0" 

alt="" width="1200" height="300"> 

	<p>After we ate I took Kelsey on the walk I had done the day before through the forest to the two lakes. All in all we 

walked and talked for about 4 hours. After our walk we took a nap and then woke up and got ready. Saturday night we went to a girl 

named Amalies house for her birthday party.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4njeapmz87oce16/Photo%20Jun%2006%2C%2010%2056%2029%20PM.jpg?dl=0" 

alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>After the party at the house we took party buses into Oslo to go out. Amalie went to a different high school then Kaja 

and Emilie so she had a different group of friends. Her group of friends were the "rich girls" or as Emilie would say the "skinny 

bitches" these girls were not necessarily the friendliest but by the time we went into the city they were very nice to us. Kaja and 

Emilie are not 20 so they couldn't go into the city, so one of their friends, Rebecca, took care of us. Me, Kelsey, and Rebecca 

split up from the rest of the group and meet up with Rebecca's cousin at an outdoor bar in the center of the park. We sat in a booth 

with blankets and heaters all around us, the cheapest beer there was 10 dollars, so we got one and milked it all night. Kaja picked 

me and Kelsey up from the city and we all went back to her house.</p>

<h1>June 13th </h1>
<a id="June13"></a>

	<p>I woke up and went to the track to do a workout with Kaja. After our work out I hung out at the house all day and got some things done. At night I went to a city festival with Emilie and Emilie. A small town closes all of the streets and has different stages with live music all around. It is a very popular event for all ages and we hung out there for a little. After the festival Emilie dropped me off to meet up with Kaja at one of her friends’ houses. I got dropped off and walked up to the door and rang the doorbell. Eivens dad answered the door and I asked if the kids were still there, he said no and looked at me very confused. I asked if I could connect to his wifi to try and figure out where they had gone. I was helpless because my ride had left and my phone doesn’t work. Luckily the dad called his son and gave me directions to the house down the street that they were at.  We hung out there for a while and then went out in Oslo. Kaja has an awesome group of guy friends here and I have gotten to know them pretty well so it is really fun to go out with them. </p>

	<p>Kaja lives about 20 minutes outside of the city so to get home we took a pretty late bus, apparently this bus is known for being all kinds of people and very interesting.  I sat next to a young guy who told me his life story during our 30 minute bus ride. He was an immigrant to Norway from Egypt and just recently received citizenship. He was kind of hard to understand, and this is the story I got from him, but some facts could be a little off. While he was in University in Egypt him and a bunch of other students were kidnapped by the bad guys. They were held hostage and tortured for a full year before they were freed. He showed me scars across his face from different things they had done to the students to be able to identify them. Once he got away he escaped to Norway. He applied for citizenship and eventually got it after 5 years and now he works at a primer school as a gym teacher. I said to him, “I thought the revolution was over and Egypt was safe?” He replied, “That’s what the media wants you to think.” He definitely made me think and gave me a better perspective on refugees. </p>



<h1>June 14th </h1>
<a id="June14"></a>

	<p>I was a total nerd and worked on my website all day!</p>


<h1>June 15th </h1>
<a id="June15"></a>

	<p>I went for a run in the forest in the morning and then I came back to pack for our road trip. We were supposed to go on a road trip and visit Kajas grandma’s house, Kajas summer house, and Emilie’s summer house. However, Kaja had a doctor’s appointment on Monday morning and found out she had to get surgery on Wednesday to take out inflammation in her ankle. Emilie can’t drive yet so we could not do our road trip, so we decidedwe would go to Stockholm for a few days. Monday night we had a little cookout at Kajas and then I worked on my website. </p>



<h1>June 16th </h1>
<a id="June16"></a>

	<p>Me and Kaja woke up on our own and then we went to run on the track. After she timed me we decided it was a really nice day so we were going to go have a picnic on one of the lakes. We put our bathing suits on and packed a backpack with lunch and our books. We walked about 45 minutes to a one cliff overlooking one of the smaller lakes. I found a rope swing and I was SO EXCITED!!!</p>

	<p>We laid on the rocks and read for a while and then made our way home. A bunch of Kaja and Emilie’s friends came over at night and we hung out and ate desert. Kaja loves to bake so a very common evening is all of her friends coming over and her baking for them. At midnight we had a cake and candle for Emilie’s 20th birthday!</p>

<p>I hung out at Kajas all morning and then Emilie, Rebecca, and Elise came over for a cook out. After the cookout Elise dropped me, Emilie, and Rebecca off at a birthday party. It is a lot of fun going to house parties here because everyone is so shocked to have an American there. So everyone wants to talk to me and thinks I'm really cool. I also got to meet a whole new group of people which was a lot of fun! I get the opportunity to talk to a lot of people about differences in America and Norway. In Norway parents leave their house for the weekend so their kids can throw a big party. There were a ton of people there and they can blast music all night without any neighbors complaining. It turned into a huge dance party in the living room and they played "West Virginia" over and over and over again. It's super random but Norwegians love that song.  Rebecca's brother picked us up and they dropped me off at Kajas. </p>

<p>We hung out at Kajas all day and didn't really do much. In the afternoon we went to watch Kajas soccer team play a game and I learned how clubs work here. They don't have school sports but everyone plays with the club closest to their home until they are 16. At 16 they either stop playing or move to a more competitive team. The craziest thing here is that they DON'T PAY for sports! Their government pays for everything from the facilities, to the refs, to the uniforms and all of the coaches are volunteer....Kaja and Emilie live in Akershus and within that providence there are 2 big clubs called Nittedal and Gjelleroasen and these clubs have the main sports like soccer, floor ball, swimming, gymnastics, and cross country skiing. For the main sports everything is payed for! In America our parents have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars for us to compleat. </p>

<p>A few of Kajas friends came over to visit her. We Google hung-out with all my friends from school, so Kaja got to meet them all. Kajas dad fixed a traditional dinner where he cooked a whole trout that he had caught last year. They freeze whole fish and then cook them and take out the meat they want. </p>

<p>We hung out at Kajas all morning and I made the video for my Sweden class. Emilie, Emilie, and Kaja went to run errands and I stayed at home and worked out. When they got back we had dinner and baked school buns. We went over to Emilies for a little and then went back to Kajas to watch the women's World Cup. Norway was playing England and Kaja has a lot of friends on Norway's team. </p>

<p>Both Emilies slept over because we left for Emilies summer house in the morning. This is the Emilie that lived with me in America and I finally meet her mom for the first time! Her summer house is like an hour away and her grandma, grandpa, grandmas sister, and brother were all there. We got there around noon and walked down to the beach to hang out. They have a diving board of rocks which was really fun. </p>

<p>After the beach we came back to the house and sat outside and played cards. They taught me some games and I taught them some. Emilies mom made us a delicious dinner! We had steak, ribs, and potato salad. After dinner we drove back to Kajas because a bunch of girls were coming over to hang out on my last night. </p>

<p>Andrea, Regina, Rebecca, Emilie, Emilie, Camilla, and Amalie all came over to Kajas and we sat around candles and talked all night. Kaja made us all "school buns" which is a Norwegian pastry. I had to say bye to all of the friends I've meet :( </p>

<p> I woke up to a delicious breakfast that Kaja and Emilie had made me.

I spent all day packing and getting my things ready, I tried very hard to not leave anything behind. So far I haven't realized anything I forgot! Kaja had a doctors appointment so Emilie and Emilie made me my last dinner. We had tacos and they were so perfect. After dinner they all drove me to the airport and for the billionth time in our life we had to say goodbye. </p>

<p>Every time we say goodbye we think "goodbyes are not forever, goodbyes are not the end, they simply mean I'll miss you until we meet again." As cliche as this quote is it could not be more true for our relationship. Good news is they are both coming to UVA in Novemeber to visit, so we won't go another two years without seeing each other! </p>
