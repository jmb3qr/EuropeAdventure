<h1> July 8th </h1>
<a id="July8"></a>


	<p> A driver picked us up at 9am and took us to a Winery named Castello Di Verrazzano situated on a hill between Florence and Siena. The driver was the father of the man who runs out bed and breakfast. His father speaks almost know English but works for IBM developing software for hotel companies. This estate was originally a beautiful castle, however, during battle between Florence and Siena everything was destroyed except for the central tower. </p>

	<p>This winery is named after Giovanni Verrazzano who was born here in 1485. Giovanni does not receive credit, but he discovered the bay of New York and most of the east coast. There is a major bridge named after him in New York which contains a memorial for him. Our tour guide walked us through the gardens and took us to an over look of the valley and the rival castle. </p>

	<p>Next we walked through the cellar and showed us all of the different rooms, one of the rooms contains one bottle from every year of production. </p>

	<p>While he was walking us around he taught us about their process. Their winery is organic and they have the highest Italian ranking for their quality, so their entire process is very tedious. This winery lays in the historic Chianti region of Tuscany so the wine they are known for is Chianti Classico. </p>

	<p> After we visited the winery we came back to our Air bnb and took a nap. When we woke up we walked to the central station and got on a hop on hop off bus. We took this bus all around the center city and got off at the Piazzale Michelangelo which has The Statue of David and is a panoramic view of Florence. </p>

	<p>We got back on the bus and took it to Ponte Vecchio which is a bridge full of shops going over the Arno river. </p>

	<p>The streets surrounding Ponte Vecchio are filled with amazing shops full of leather and jewelry. We walked to the Duomo which was absolutely breath taking! In the late afternoon the sun shines on it absolutely perfectly.</p>

	<p> We continued walking to find a place for dinner, since gramps is a simpleton we had to find a menu with spaghetti and meat sauce. Fortunately we are in Italy so that is easy to find, while in Austria and Germany we might be finding a lot of McDonald's. We walked back to the hotel and tried to get a good night sleep. </p>


<h1> July 9th </h1>
<a id="July9"></a>

	<p> We slept in late and then got on another hop on hop off bus that took us to an old city looking over Florence. We had reservations at the Uffizi at 1:15, so we got there a little early to collect our tickets and get in line. Luckily I was able to get gramps a wheelchair so I could push him through the museum and he could enjoy everything. The Uffizi was full of statues of naked people and paintings of Jesus. </p>

	<p>After we worked our way through the gallery I wanted to walk back to Ponte Vecchio and shop so grampa sat in the Palazzo Vecchio and waited for me. <p>

	<p> I was looking for a pair of short black boots but couldn't find anything that I liked. When I returned we started walking towards the Academia. This is the gallery that holds the statue of David. Once again I was able to get grandpa a wheelchair to make seeing everything easier. Having him in a wheelchair was great because everyone got out of our way immediately. </p>

	<p>The Academia was much much smaller than the Uffizi so we got through it pretty fast. Me and grandpa are very similar where our idea of seeing art is walking past it. When we left we walked to the main leather street with all of the vendors so that gramps could buy some presents for people. Once he picked out the presents, he went back to the room and I walked around a bit more. When I returned we walked to dinner. He wanted to go back to the place we went the first night because he really liked their spaghetti :) </p>

<p> It is definitely a way different mind set traveling with someone who is older. He is in great shape but because of his knees and back he can only walk a couple of blocks before he needs a break. This makes maneuvering a large cobble stone city very difficult. I think after just two days I have a very good idea of his ability and of how to figure out how to maximize what we see without exhausting him. We are in a bit of a marathon the next 10 days so I didn't want to kill him on the first few days. I think it's important he develops trust in me, so that He knows I will not push his limits. I hope in 65 years I can be as mobile, clear minded, and adventure seeking as him! </p>
