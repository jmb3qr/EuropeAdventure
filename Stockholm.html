<h1>June 17</h1>
<a name="June17"></a>

	<p>I woke up early and packed for Stockholm. Kaja drove me and Emilie to the flybussen station. In Europe they have these awesome buses that take you from anywhere to the airport for about 10 dollars. Me and Emilie got to Stockholm about the same time Kaja was done with surgery. Kajas surgery went perfectly and she was in no pain after. Me and Emilies flight was pretty crazy, it was the closest I've ever been to thinking my plane was going to crash... The last 20 minutes of the flight there was so much turbulence that my stomach was dropping every few seconds. Every single person was holding onto their arm rests for dear life. After a huge drop me and the guy across the aisle looked at each other in panic and started talking! He was from Norway and played soccer in Connecticut! He was so nice and we had a lot in common and had a great conversation. He was doing a road trip with some of his Swedish friends for midsummers. Many people in Sweden are trying to change their national day to be midsummers because it is celebrated more than their national day. Midsummers is centered around the summer solstice and people celebrate by getting out of the city and going to their summer houses for the weekend.</p>

	<p>We took flybussen from the airport to the city center and before we walked to our hostel we stopped at the tourist information center to get a Stockholm card. The card is 50 dollars a day to go to every museum and to use the public transport. We wanted to stay at The City Backpackers Hostel which is the young, hip, fun hostel but since we booked the day before there were no rooms left. When we booked the only hostels left were either super cheap (and had terrible reviews) or kind of expensive and for an older crowd. We ended up staying in a very nice and quiet hostel in old town.</p>

<p>We got to the hostel and then decided to try and make it to some of the museums that didn't close until 8. We went to a cathedral near our hostel.</p>

	<p>Stockholm is not very tourist friendly... It's impossible to find anything! Museums are barely marked at all. We left the hotel and were relaying on the addressee’s on trip advisor however all of these were wrong.

We tried to find an economy museum and couldn't find it so then we went to the Nobel Prize museum. It was kind of small and not very good. Next we attempted to find the mid-evil museum and couldn't find it. Then we tried to go in the opera but couldn't figure out how to get in and we weren't sure if it was open.</p>

	<p>We finally stumbled upon the Mediterranean and near eastern antiques museum. It was an okay museum, it had big exhibits on Egypt and Corsica.</p>

	<p>We walked to the grocery store and then walked back to our hostel. We had wine, brie, and cheese as an appetizer before we went out to dinner. We walked around the streets until we found a place we wanted to eat. It was Emilies birthday so we were splurging on dinner. The hostess was one of the best salesmen I've ever meet. I told him I wanted jack on the rocks because it was the cheapest drink and he said, "oh you like whiskey you must try our whiskey sour." I said okay and went from getting the cheapest drink to the most expensive. What a conn artist! After dinner we went to bed early. We stayed in 6 bed mixed dorm so we were sung to sleep by snoring men.</p>

<h1>June 18</h1>

	<p>We woke up at 9 so that we could start our hard core tourism early. The Stockholm pass is known for being pretty expensive so we knew we had to do a lot to get our money's worth. The first thing we did was tour the palace, the part we got to walk through was pretty small. We wanted to go to the Vasa museum but had to take a ferry over to it. We asked directions from about 10 people and it took us an hour and a half of walking in circles before we finally found the ferry. I don't think our struggle was because we're idiots, the tourism in Stockholm is ridiculously unorganized! The Vasa Is their biggest museum and there is not one sign helping you get there. We finally got on a ferry that took us to Grona Lund which is an amusement park next to the museum. We decided to stop in and go on some rides in Grona Lund. In America you pay to go to an amusement park and that includes doing everything in the amusement park. In Europe you pay an entrance fee and then have to pay for each individual ride. Once we realized that we decided to leave. We started walking towards the Vasa museum. We stopped and went to the aquarium which had about 2 stingrays and 4 shark. Next we went to the Spirits museum which is a museum about alcohol. The main exhibits were one on absolute vodka and one on beer. The beer exhibit had jars of all the different wheat’s and hops that you could smell and try to identify which made what beer. <p>

	<p>Finally we made it to the Vasa museum and it was the first thing that had actually been worth paying money to see. The Vasa is a giant ship that was built in 1626. </p>

	<p>This ship sunk on its first voyage in 1628 and was not restricted until 1961. This ship sunk because it was too top heavy. The very bottom of a ship used to be filled with giant rocks. There was a layer of rocks and then a few layers of storage and then the layer with the cannons. The engineers knew that the ship needed more rocks but if they added more rocks then the cannons would have been too high and so they ignored the issue of weight. Obviously that wasn’t a good idea because the ship never made it out of the Stockholm harbor. The metropolitan area of Stockholm is composed of 14 islands and has a population of 2.25 million people.</p>

<p> We took the ferry back to SkeppsHolmen which is one of the little islands. We walked onto another tiny island called Kastelholmen which has a fort on top of it that used to protect the city. This building is called the citadel and is not converted into office buildings. </p>

	<p>Next we went to the contemporary art museum which was AWESOME!!! It wasn’t like the Oslo one where they put a blank piece of paper on the wall and called it art. The art was less abstract and more meaningful to someone like me who doesn’t appreciate a blank piece of paper. One of the exhibits was about world peace and it had really powerful letters written by a lady who was visiting Stockholm. When she was visiting Stockholm in the 60’s she fell subject to a lot of anti-American people. People would yell at her in the streets and scream things at her like “fascist pig, LEAVE!” She was so upset that she booked a flight back to America and started writing letters to different people to try and bring about a change. Now all of her letters appear in this exhibit.
My favorite exhibit was on the myth of normality. This was a powerful slideshow that started of showing pictures of extremely deformed faces and bodies from a long time ago and ancient artifacts of deformed face sculptures.</p>

	<p> It then showed a lot of pictures of ancient artifacts that had been broken and had been formed back together in beautiful ways.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/afbzrkjbwkyf4xb/Photo%20Jun%2018%2C%203%2034%2041%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p> Then it showed pictures of modern things that had been broken and had been glued back together so that they looked “normal” again. Then it showed modern day deformed faces and pictures of  their stitches and surgery process to become “normal”.</p>
 
	<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/r31qo3oikj1z9nd/Photo%20Jun%2018%2C%203%2031%2017%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p>I think the point of this exhibit is to show that compared to the length of society the idea of everyone looking a certain way is a new concept. The beauty should be in the repair and not in looking “normal.”
Another cool exhibit was one that featured different sea life like coral, seaweed, and driftwood with running shoes in them. I think the purpose of this exhibit was to symbolize that people are “walking all over the earth.” At this point in the day our attention span was dwindling and so we only looked at half of the art. On our walk home we stopped at the mid-evil museum. It wasn’t relaly anything special but that could be because we were over it. It was finally time for FIKA!!! We went to a super cute café in old town and enjoyed a Swedish cinnamon bun and a coffee. </p>

	<p>We had dinner and got ready at our hostel. I knew that one of the guys I hiked with in Lofoten’s next stop was Stockholm. I facebook messaged him and asked if he was still around. He said yes and told us to come to a pub crawl that night at his hostel. He was staying at the cool hip hostel we wanted to stay out but was fully booked. The pub crawl was with about 15 people and it was awesome! There were people from Switzerland, Austria, London, Perth Australia, Sydney, Mexico City, Scotland, Brazil, Toronto, Salt lake city. We had a really good crew and went to about 6 different bars enjoying a drink at each.</p>

	<p>We woke up and checked out of the hostel. We walked to one of the churches and then walked to the Photography museum.</p>

<p>Unfortunately because of midsummers the photography museum was closed. Then we walked through old town to the City Hall. We took a historical river boat cruise and then got FIKA! We walked around the city a little longer and then walked to the bus station to get back to the airport. We got back to Oslo and I told Kaja all about the trip!</p>
