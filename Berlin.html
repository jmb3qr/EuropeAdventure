<h1> July 22nd </h1>
<a id="July22"></a>


	<p> I woke up and went to the train station to try and reserve a ticket to Norway but the office wasn't open yet. At 11 I went on a bike tour of Berlin. I got put but in the best group ever! It was an entire wedding party and the groom was from Mexico and the bride from Sweden. They had both played sports at Clemson and meet. The husband had played soccer so a lot of the guys with them were all on the team. The girl had played tennis at Clemson and then transferred to Two Lane and so most of the girls had played tennis with her. All of these girls and guys also brought their significant others so it ended up a group of 20 people. </p>

	<p> The bride and her two brothers were from Lund, Sweden where I studied earlier this summer. I was taking to one of the girls and I said "my brothers went to South Carolina" and she said "I'm from Charleston" and I said "Do you know Alex Thornton?" She said "holy shit that's my sister!" The girl I had just meet, Caroline, is Scott's ex-girlfriends little sister. It makes you realize how small the world is. One of the guys had started a tech business in Chattanooga and was from Virginia. The bike tour was 6 hours long so you got an opportunity to talk to everyone. </p>

	<p> Our first stop was the television tower which was built in the 70s and stands out so much in the city. The next place we went to was the national library which is right next to a University. During WWII students from the university raided the library and many other libraries around Berlin and took all of the books that were "anti Nazi," (almost every single book fit into this category) and they burned them. They built a memorial underneath the square that is a room with a bookshelf big enough to hold of the books that were burned. There is a little sunroof window on the ground that you can look through to see all of the book shelves. </p>

	<p> Our next stop was Gendarmenmarkt which is a square containing two identical churches that were built facing each other and the concert hall. One of the churches was built for France and one for Germany and the two churches are almost identical except the German one was built a meter taller. On the corners of these churches there are statues and they are the only part of the church that are original. When Hitler found out that the SS was coming into Berlin he started hiding the cities art and valuables. Hitler loved the Prussian architecture so he wanted to preserve it. He went around taking down statues and then threw them in the rivers so that they would be safe. Years later all of these statues were pulled out of the river and placed on the corners of these churches. <p>

	<p> Our next stop was Check Point Charlie. During the Berlin Wall there were three major check points (A, B, C) and Charlie was guarded by US soldiers. The part about this sight that made me mad was there were street guys dressed up in US uniforms and charging people money to take pictures with them in front of the gate. I thought that this was really disrespectful. </p>

	<p> Our next stop was a piece of the Berlin Wall that sits right next to a building that was built before the war. This building was built by Nazis and was a very important office building. At the end of the war the Soviets took it over and made it offices for the most communist people. They needed to make sure that the people in this building were believers because it was right next to the wall. One day a man snuck his wife and two children into the building. They waited for nightfall and then they threw a rope from a window to the west side. They had people on the west side secure it and one by one they slide across in homemade canvas harnesses. It is recorded that the guard saw them escaping and decided not to shoot. On the top of the wall they originally put barbed wire but then they realized people were using the barbed wire to pull themselves over, so they replaces it with a piece of pipe that no one could grip on to.</p>

	<p> We rode by one of the only guard towers that is still standing. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/3levqfqsmv49zk3/php0zcRA0PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p>We rode through the Tier Garden which was one of the best parts of the day. The Garden is massive and smells so good and has such a cool breeze. We rode to a bear garden and enjoyed some sausages, schnitzel, and beers. </p>

	<p> After lunch we rode past the Berlin Victory Column which is in place to celebrate the Prussian victory over Denmark, Austria, and France in three separate wars. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cq4ay8x0r1fl9kw/phpaokRJOPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p>This Column is built in the middle of the Tier Garden and all around it you can see bullet holes in the concrete.  </p>

	<p> Our last stop was the Reichstag building which was home to the German Parliament from 1894 to 1933. The building was extremely damaged in WWII and after fell into disuse for the East Germans used a different building and so did the West Germans. When Germany was reunifies in 1990 they began to fully refurbish the buildings. Today the building has a large glass dome that people can go into to see a view of the city. This glass dome also has glass floors so the people can see down, it is supposed to be a symbol to the Parliament that the people are always on top and always have control. </p>

	<p> After the bike tour I wondered around Alexanderplatz a little and listened to some street performers. I went back to the train station to reserve my ticket and then went back to my hostel. I contacted Jason to meet up for dinner. We tried to go to a sushi restaurant but we sat there for 30 minutes and no one served us so we ended up going to an American Dinner. They were complaining about the service a lot and I didn't really want to listen to them anymore so I just went back to my hostel after dinner. In Berlin there are prostitutes all over the streets so my walk home I passed lot. When I got back to my hostel I hung out a little bit downstairs but then just decided to go to bed. Some of the guys came into my room and convinced me to come back down. </p>

	<p> At the bar we decided to play flip cup with some English people. All the of the people I was hanging out with were not very mature and they were all arguing about who’s way was better. I got frustrated because traveling is supposed to be about learning different ways to do something not arguing that your way is better. I finally stood up and was like who cares! Who cares if I say aluminum and you say a-lu-minium. I ended up just going back upstairs and going to bed. </p>



<h1>July 23rd </h1>
<a id="July23"></a>


	<p> I woke up and treated myself to Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I went on a free walking tour with a man named Rob. We started at Brandenburger gate and he showed us the famous hotel where Michael Jackson dangled his baby out the window. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/mcsihaj573xn58s/Photo%20Jul%2024%2C%202%2013%2007%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p> Our first stop was at the Holocaust Memorial, Rob didn’t really give us much history but he encouraged us to take our time to walk from one side to the other and when we got to the other side to talk about what we thought. It was really interesting to hear different people’s perspective. One interesting thing is that the cubes are painted with an anti-graffiti solution. The company that produced this solution is the same company that produced all of the gas for the gas chambers during the war. When this was discovered the community was outraged and in order to make amends the company donated all of the solution. We talked about how the cubes make you feel lost but at the same time give you a sense of hope because you can always see the way out. We also talked about how it was related to the Jewish cemetery in Prague. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ktyyjxqryk15d82/php2qGneNPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p> We went to a lot of the same sights as we did the day before but surprisingly I heard very different stories from the two guides. On my tour there was one Asian family that was so Rude!! At one point Rob asked everyone to listen and not take pictures and they stood right behind him taking a ton of family pictures and then the lady walked up to him and was like, "I want to go there," and he was like, "sorry our tour doesn't go there." and she got mad! They were so rude and then they ended up leaving the tour early and not tipping him. </p>

	<p> Rob did a really good job of making all of the history make sense and filled in gaps that I had from the other tour. We learned the real reason the Berlin Wall came down. Gorbachev had started making some political reforms in the years prior which put the East Berlin officials in a bind. In order to manage they decided to make minor changes to their travel laws. On November 9th, 1989 East Germany had a meeting to discuss the new travel laws and a man Schabowski skipped out on the meeting. However, he was the man to announce this to the public later that evening. He went on national television and announced “trips abroad will be possible for every citizen.” Immediately the crowd freaked out and started asking “WHEN!?” To this he answered, “Right now immediately.” This started a massive dash for the wall and the border patrols had no idea what was happening. This picture painted on the East Side Gallery depicts the crowds rushing through the gates. </p>

	<p> While on the tour I made friends with four Australian kids and ended up hanging out with the girl Bella later. After the tour I went to lay in the Tier Garden and read my book for a little and then I went to the Modern Art Museum. This museum is one of the biggest in Europe but I thought it was awful. None of the art really caught my attention and I thought the exhibits were way to big. </p>

	<p> When I got back to my hostel I texted Bella and asked if she wanted to get dinner. We walked over three miles to get to this place called Thursday Night Street food. It was a giant building filled with street food carts from all over the world (very similar to the one in Copenhagen.) </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/3ncwv0kge3ey4u6/Photo%20Jul%2023%2C%209%2018%2025%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

<p>We each got different things and then sat outside and enjoyed them. After dinner we got Waffles with ice cream on top and went to sit in a park. We were both very like minded people so we got along really well. When I got back to the hostel I was hoping to find people I wanted to go out with but unfortunately I didn't. The wedding party contacted me again to go out and I was really hoping it would work out but it didn't.</p>


<h1> July 24th </h1>
<a id="July24"></a>


	<p> I texted Bella as soon as I woke up to meet downstairs. I had to shower and pack up all of my stuff first so I could check out. After breakfast we took the metro to the East Side Gallery. This is the longest strip of the Berlin Wall still standing. The wall is covered in graffiti some good and some eh.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jejtgl2e0qwxjpk/Photo%20Jul%2024%2C%2010%2053%2009%20AM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p> One of the most famous ones is the two guys kissing but I liked some of it that had words better.</p>

	<p> We walked the whole length and went to a hippie compound type thing. This place has a lot of graffiti and it’s kind of like a little Jamaica. We tried to go to the top of the glass dome at Reichstag but the queue was way too long so we decided to go to the holocaust museum. The holocaust museum was really good and it started with the quote, “It happened, therefore it can happen again, this is the core of what we are trying to say,” Primo Levi. I really liked this quote because when you think about the world it is just so messed up and people are so brainwashed/ignorant that anyone could have the borrow to turn a group of people against another group. My grandpa said, “Jeannie, if you want power, pick a group of people, and pick on them.” The holocaust museum laid everything out by date and then also quotes from people and stories about families.</p>

	<p>I left Bella and went on a communism tour lead by Rob. This tour was so good and I learned so much. Towards the end of WWII Roosevelt agreed to hold back and let The Soviet Union conquer Berlin which ended up being a huge mistake. This left The Soviet Union to think that they had more of a right to control Berlin. After the war The Allies realized that they did not see eye to eye with The Soviets so they separated Germany into West and East Germany and gave the Soviets East and Split the west between France, Britain, and the US. They did the same thing with Berlin, however, West Berlin laid in the middle of East Germany. In the begging of the division between the East and West was open and anyone could get a passport to go to the other. However, the conditions in East Germany were so bad that all of the educated people were leaving for the West. This caused a brain drain which made East Germany suffer even more. The East realized that everyone was leaving so they started to make secret plans to close the border between East and West Berlin. They kept all of the supplies outside of town and told everyone they were planning on building a large housing development.  On June 15th, 1961 First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, Walter Ulbricht, stated in an international press conference, „ No one has the intention of erecting a wall,” and this was the first time the word “wall” was used. On the night of August 13th, 1961 The Soviets put up a barbed wire fence that completely surrounded West Germany (124 miles). From August 14th, 1961 to November 9th, 1989 only 5,000 people escaped most of these being in the first months of the temporary wall. A lot of the people that managed to escape were Soviet Soldiers. This famous picture is of a Soldier who decides to run to the East side while on post and is greeted by open arms on the West. </p>

	<p> 136 people died while attempting to cross over to West Berlin and there is a monument in the death strip for all of these people. The death strip was the space between the two walls. There was a wall on the East side and then another wall on the West side. Most people died in the death strip. </p>

	<p>One of the most famous deaths is of a boy named Peter Fechter. Him and his friend were on lunch break in a building when they decided to make a run for it. A guard yelled at them to stop and Peter stopped while his friend kept running. His friend made it over the wall and the Guard shot Peter dead. He shot him as he was touching the western wall so the entire west heard his screams and could look over the wall and see his body. They were yelling at the guard to help him and the guard let Peter bleed to death in front of millions of Western eyes. This is one of the first big stories that allowed people to see what East Germany was doing to their people.  </p>

	<p> We heard a lot of escape stories from people windsurfing to Denmark to people building homemade hot air balloons. Another really famous story is of this old lady who is going out her window, being helped by people on the west, when a soviet troop starts to try and pull her back into the window. </p>

	<p> After the tour I went back to my hostel grabbed my bag and headed for the train station. I was on a night train from Berlin to Malmo, Sweden. I had a great car of people all between 20 and 24. It was a French guy, three Sweds, and an American. We had a great time talking and playing cards. The train rode to the top of Germany and then the entire train got onto a Cruise and we sailed to Sweden. We got to Sweden the next morning at 7 and then I took a train to Gothenburg and then a train to Oslo. When I got to Oslo, I took the bus to Kajas house. I took me 24 hours to get there. </p>
