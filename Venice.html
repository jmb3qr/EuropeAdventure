<h1> July 10th </h1>
<a id="July10"></a>

	<p> We had to wake up early and get on our train to Venice. Our train was delayed an hour and a half because someone jumped in front of a train somewhere else. Grandpa had to get a first class ticket because of his age so we weren't sitting together. I realized I hadn't communicated very well where to get off so at one of the stops I sprinted to the front of the train to make sure he hadn't gotten off. When I got up there I met a very nice family who had befriended him. Once we were in Venice we consolidated all of the things we would need for the next 2 days into one bag and stored the rest at the train station. I figured this would be much easier then lugging it to our Air bnb and then lugging it back. </p>

	<p> We grabbed some lunch and then we started walking to our air bnb. Once we checked in gramps took a nap and I went to tour the city a little. While he was seeping I went and figured out our plans, got our passes to get on the boats, and figured out the schedules. I walked around for a little and then went to pick him up. There was a boat stop really close to our air bnb so it was perfect! This was the boat stop. </p>

	<p>We got on a boat and took it to Piazza San Marco, while we were on the boat we meet two young girls from Buffalo New York and talked to them for a while. When we got off the boat one of the girls asked if she could adopt grandpa. </p>

	<p> We toured the Doge Palace which was beautiful! They put so much money and time into every single part of it! </p>

	<p>After we toured the palace we looked at Plaza San Marco and then hoped back on the boat to go to dinner. This time of year Italy is insanly packed with tourist. This is the view of one of the bridges in Plaza San Marco.</p>

	<p>We headed back towards our apartment so that we could get some dinner around there. The sun was setting on our ride home which made the boat ride even more beautiful.</p>

	<p> We went to a cute outdoor restaurant for dinner. Gramps got spaghetti and meatball, what a surprise, and I got pasta with fish. My meal was the best meal I've had so far! After dinner we headed back to the room to get a good night sleep. </p>

	<p> We woke up early so we could maximize our time left in Venice. We walked to the dock and got on one of the boats. Our first stop on the boat was the Rialto Market. This is a market full of fruits, vegetables, and fish.</p>

			<p>While we were on the boat we meet the nicest group of American girls. They had all just graduated and had played volleyball in college. They came to Europe to coach a beach volleyball camp all summer. They work all week and get the weekends off to travel. In Venice there are no roads at all, or no roads that are wide enough for cars. This is a picture of the "main street" of Venice. </p>

	<p>We got off and toured the II Redentore, which is a stunning church, and then got back on the boat.</p>

	<p> We stopped at the San Zaccaria church and grandpa got some tea while I wondered around. When I was finished wondering we walked to a busy street and stopped at a cafe for spritz and lunch.</p>

	<p> We got back on the boat and headed to La Biennale de Venazia, Gardini. At this garden they have a huge art exhibit that they host every two years. Many people come to Venice just to see this collection. There are 2 exhibits, one is broken up by artist and one is broken up by country. We wanted to go but you could only buy a pass to visit both and we only had time to see one. We hopped back on the boat and went to San Pietro di Castello. This church was amazing! It was the size of a football field inside and absolutely beautiful! A lady told me that all of the famous Doges had been buried there. A doge is an elected chief of state, that ruled many Italian states in the medieval and Renaissance periods. </p>

	<p> We walked to one more church and then I tried to make a loop back to the same boat stop. Directions in Venice can be exremely difficult, so we ended having to back track and go the way we came. </p>

	<p>headed back to the boat. We took the boat back to the train station and had a couple of hours to kill so we sat and people watched or as grandpa would say, girl watched.</p>

	<p>^^We are still trying to figure out where I got my linebacker genes. ^^</p>
	<p></p>
	<p> Grandpa got Burger King for dinner and then we went to a real place for dinner. I got black fish pasta, which was like eating the mud at the bottom of the canal... It actually tasted pretty good but the color and texture really threw me off. </p>

	<p>After dinner we picked up our luggage and took a train to the main train station. Grandpa wanted to get there early but we ended up being there 3 hours early and had to sit in the train station and wait. </p>

<p> Gramps was in first class in a three person sleeper, he said he was with a bunch of nerds that took all of the plugs. I was in second class in a 6 bed couchette. This is a tiny room with 6 beds that are more or less hard pieces of foam.  My sleeper had 4 older people from Vienna in it who were awesome. They had just gone to Venice for the art exhibit in the Biennale park. This was there third time going and they said that this years exhibit was far more political than it had been in the past. The title of it this year was "the future of all worlds." They talked to me and shared their wine with me and gave me restaurant recommendations  for Vienna. I crawled up on my Litle bed and slept through the whole night. </p>
