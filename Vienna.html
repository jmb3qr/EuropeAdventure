<h1> July 12th </h1>
<a id="July12"></a>

	<p> We arrived in Vienna at 8 in the morning and gramps got some McDonald's. We took a bus to our Air bnb and the people were so nice. When we got there they sat and gave us coffee and tea and talked to us. The man grew up in the Austrian Alps and had an amazing map in his kitchen of the alps. We talked about the map forever and had him point out many different things to us. </p>

	<p> We headed out for a long day of tourism and took the tram into the city center. We got on grandpas favorite hop on hop off bus at the opera house and took it all around the city. The nice thing about hop on hop off buses is they give you head phones and you get to hear a little history about every building you pass, however gramps gets on the bus and doesn't use the headphones, he just sits and looks. Sometimes he falls asleep :) </p>

	<p> After the bus ride we went to Starbucks and I could finally get an iced coffee! We walked to Stephansdom cathedral, which is in the very center of the city.</p>

	<p>We walked a little bit further to the Spanish ridding school. </p>

	<p>I went to the Albertina Art museum and gramps sat outside and waited. This art museum had everything from Picaso to Lee Miller to modern day things. The Exhibit on Lee Miller was awesome! She was a photographer who grew up in New York City as a model. At a young age she moved to London to continue modeling and start photography. She started as a photographer for British vogue and took a lot of pictures of naked women doing different things. One of her famous photos from this time was a picture of a women's severed breast being served on a plate with a fork in knife symbolizing how women's bodies were treated as a piece of meat. Later in her life she became one of only five women who got to photograph the front lines of World War II. She had a pass to photograph everything! She got to take pictures in Hitler’s apartment directly after he committed suicide. This exhibit told the story of her life through all the different types of pictures she took. </p>

	<p> The next exhibit I enjoyed was a room full of really famous people such as Picaso, Monet, and Alberto Giacometti. The Albertina gets most of their paintings from people who die and leave their personal collections to the museum. The man that invented the birth control pill and cortisone is who donated most of the paintings in this exhibit. </p>

	<p> My absolute favorite exhibit was the drawing exhibit! It was very very political but insanely interesting. One of the best pieces was a giant chalk board with different eye opening things written on it. </p>

	<p> My next favorite piece was a piece called interior thinking which is a series of drawings that takes you through the human life cycle. </p>

	<p> I felt like I had been in there forever so I walked out to meet up with grandpa. Once I meet up with him we stopped at a street food cart to get some sausages. After we finished eating we walked through the Hofburg gardens, then we went to the museum of natural history. I only hope that when I am my grandpas age that I can still act like a little kid the way he does. His ability to play is absolutley amazing. </p>

	<p>The museum of natural history looks at the Kunsthistorishes museum which is apparently on the same level as the Louvre and the Rijks Museum. It is a giant museum with a bunch of old paintings and artifacts which I wasn’t really interested in, however the building was beautiful.</p>

	<p> We decided to go to the natural history museum and it was good but it was so big that we didn't really have the attention span for it. It was lots of rocks and taxidermied animals. After the museum we got on a hop on hop off bus and headed towards the Rathaus. While we were there we sat and had a drink. The area in front is called the Rathausplaz and it was very similar to Copenhagen street food. It is a large courtyard that is field with all different food carts and different drink cards. After we finished our drinks we walked to the park area and took a nap. I was so tired from the night before that I passed out right on the grass. </p>


	<p> When we woke up we walked passed the parliament building and headed for dinner.</p>

	<p> The restaurant we went to was the one the ladies on the train had recommended. </p>

	<p>On our walk home from dinner grampa saw a magazine on the ground that was flipped open to this page, so obiviously he had to pick it up. </p>

	<p>As we were walking we also stumbled upon an amazing street concert. It was a group of 4 guys and the only instrument they were using was a ukulele type thing and a saxophone. They made all of the drum beats with their mouth. Even though all of these songs were in German they were still very good. I loved watching this band cause all their friends were there and it reminded me of me and all of my friends watching our best friend shamus. There was a 60 year old couple that was killing the dance floor and they also made me very happy. Once we were tired of the concert we walked to the tram line and got a ride back home. Once we were at the air bnb we relied and got ready for the morning. </p>
