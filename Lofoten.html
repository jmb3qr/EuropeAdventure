<h1> June 7th </h1>
<a id="June7"></a>


	<p>We woke up early and drove to the airport, we flew from Oslo to Harstad which is in the very north of Norway. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/u5knrb7vxm4qovz/Photo%20Jun%2007%2C%201%2013%2013%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>Our flight got in around 2 and we had to wait a couple hours for a bus from Harstad to Svolvær. Once in Svolvær we had to buy groceries and get to our camp site. Unfortunately it was 8 O'clock on a Sunday night and most places are closed on Sunday in Norway. We had to walk a few kilometers to find a tiny store that was open and pick up groceries for the rest of the week. We realized it was going to be a 45 minute walk to our campsite so we sat outside the grocery until someone nice walked out and asked them for a ride. A girl that just graduated high school lived in the neighborhood where our campsite was so she gave us a ride! Kaja thought people would be more wiling to take us if we were American so she pretended to speak English. Once at our campsite we set up our tent, made dinner, and got ready for bed. I must say this was one of the longest nights of my life..... I don't think I have ever been so cold. I was wearing 4 layers on my bottoms, 5 on my top, a hat, and gloves. And I was still cold to the bone and couldn't sleep. Icing on the cake was that my thermarest had a hole in it... So I was also sleeping on the ground.</p>

<h1>June 8th</h1>
<a id="June8"></a>


	<p>We woke up in a panic, the sun had hit our tent and raised the temperature so rapidly that we woke up and thought we were suffocating in all of our layers. We fought to unzip our sleeping bags and take off layers as  fast as possible. We walked down to the reception area and a young kid offered to give us a ride down to town. We went to the tourist center and picked up a map of Lofoten and then walked to rent our bikes. After we got our bikes I went for a hike and Kaja went on a boat ride through the fjords.</p>

	<p>In Norway they don't really mark trails and even when they do, you think there is no way you could possibly be on a trail. They label things as a "family hike" when they are extremely difficult. I started on this hike by myself and it was more like rock climbing, I was climbing over boulders as big as me and pretty much scaling a waterfall. Once I got to the base I looked across and noticed a group of four young guys, I screamed over and asked if they were hiking to the top. When they said yes, I asked if I could join them.</p>

	<p>The five of us hiked to the top together. Three of the guys were in University in Scotland together, one from Sweden, one from England, and one from Malaysia. The fourth guy was a rando from Australia that they had picked up. They had all been trying to hike The Kings Trail in Sweden but the path still had so much ice and snow on it that it wasn't possible. The guys from Scotland meet the Australian there and they decided to take a train to Lofoten together. We hiked to this rock called the Devils bridge and then continued along the ridge of the mountain. </p>

	<p>The view of Svolvær and the surrounding mountains was absolutely beautiful! </p>

	<p>From the top we all sat on our butts and sledded down all of the snow! At the bottom we parted ways and I went to meet up with Kaja. </p>

	<p>That night we ate and went to our tent to read, Kaja agreed to switch sleeping bags with me :) but I had to stay on the deflated thermarest.</p>


<h1>June 9th</h1>

	<p>Our original plane was to bike 100 miles from Svolvær to Å. However, we realized that the bike ride would be way to dangerous and difficult in the forecasted weather because the next few days were supposed to be filled with heavy rain and heavy wind. So we decided to give in our bikes and use the buses to travel from town to town. We didn’t want to bike 100 miles in this.</p> 

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/lzcj1zhj7x9gpn6/Photo%20Jun%2009%2C%2011%2014%2046%20AM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>Once we realized we weren’t biking we had to study the map and figure out a new plan.</p> 

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/gpmprmuqgm6w62n/Photo%20Jun%2008%2C%209%2017%2047%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>The next bus from Svolvær did not leave until 8 at night so we had a whole day to spend in Svolvær in the pouring rain. We went to a cafe and enjoyed pastries and coffee. We went to a really famous Norweigen war museum that had all different things from world war 2. The war museum was filled with items that one man had collected. He was working, so he got to tell us all about anything that we were interested in. This museum is special because all of the placks told the truth. It was very interesting for Kaja because she was learning a whole different side to all of the things she had learned in school growing up.  After the museum we went and sat in a hotel lobby for a couple of hours to relax by a fire and read our books. We meet an extremely nice couple from Frankfurt that sat and talk to us for an hour or so and told us to look them up on couch surfing if we were ever in Frankfurt. We finally got on the bus and took it to Ramberg. The bus ride was absolutely beautiful even in the terrible weather. As soon as we got to our campsite the first ray of sun showed through and it was beautiful! We ran on the beach like little kids! </p>

	<p>We sat up camp and we cooked dinner. This was a very social campsite with a good social area which allowed for meeting people. We talked to a lot of people about their plans that were changed because of the weather and what their new plans were. We meet three girls, one from holland, one from Connecticut, and one from Norway who had been getting around hitchhiking and we though, "hey that sounds like a pretty good idea."</p>

<h1>June 10th </h1>
<a id="June10"></a>


	<p>We woke up around 11 and started making breakfast, we noticed that everyone in all of the cabins was beggining to pack up and realized their check out time was noon. We noticed all the campers were hurrying to pack up to ask for rides from all the people driving. I noticed a guy packing up his car all by myself so I went over to him and asked where he was going. He was going to Å so I asked if we could have a ride to Reine which is on the way. The easy thing about Lofoten is there is only one road through the whole peninsula so every person is either going north or south. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/epmn4ut4gsjilht/Photo%20Jun%2011%2C%201%2019%2048%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>This guy said he had to go ask his girl friend for permission so me and Kaja started scrambling to get packed up. We took down our tent and packed our entire site in less than ten minutes and his girlfriend said yes. We took a pretty awkward ride down to Reine. Once in Reine we re-packed all of our stuff and then walked around the super small town. There is a famous hike in Reine called Reinebringen but the weather was way to bad to do it. After we walked around we went in a cafe to escape the rain. The ladies in the cafe were so nice and they served us coffee and waffles. After our coffee break we walked up to an overlook which is known as being one of the prettiest views in the world. We waited for it to clear up a little so we could get a good picture. </p>

	<p>A couple stopped and we offered to take their picture, we got to talking and it turned out they were also on their way to Å, and they offered us a ride to Moskenes. The couple was a very nice couple from Romania working in the oil industry in Oslo. After they dropped us off we walked to our campsite in Moskenes and set up our tent. It was still pretty ugly outside. We cooked dinner in our tent and then enjoyed the silence by reading our books. Unfortunately we both finished our books so we had nothing else to read. We went to bed and hoped for better weather in the morning.</p>

	<p>We woke up late and the sun was finally almost shinning! We walked to the grocery store which was about a mile away and then took a bus to Å. In Norway they make this dried fish called Tørrfisk by hanging fish in wooden racks outside, and it smells absolutely awful. At the base of the mountain in Å there are a ton of these fish racks. The wind was blowing from the mountains so the entire village smelt like rotten fish! </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/13778yzbhn1fbfc/Photo%20Jun%2010%2C%207%2037%2052%20AM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>We walked around Å and decided were ready to go back to camp.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/p9fpfml8j5tm24d/Photo%20Jun%2011%2C%202%2041%2045%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>The bus didn't leave for awhile so we sat at the visitors center and once a nice couple came by we asked them where they were headed. We were at the southern most point of Lofoten so everyone was going towards where we wanted to go. A nice young Chinese couple was headed to Svolvær and they gave us a ride. Some rides were more awkward than others..</p>

	<p>Once back at camp we hung out and made dinner in our tent again. Kaja was able to start reading my book but since hers was in Norwegian I just went to bed early</p>

	<p>One of myfavorite things in the world is rainbows, if I ever see a rainbow while im driving I will get out of my car and chase the rainbow. The weather in Lofoten was pretty terrible, even if it got nice out, it rained about every ten minutes. One of the best parts of the terrible weather, was that after every rain came a beautiful rainbow!</p>

<p>We woke up and packed up all of our stuff to get on the ferry from Moskenes to Bodø. The view leaving Moskenes was beautiful! </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tlmcabwa66vn96k/phpMuTiRXAM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>The ferry took a couple of hours and then we walked from the dock to the airport. We had to wait a while for our flight to Oslo. Once we landed in Oslo we went back to Kajas house and her mom had waffles waiting for us! We were so excited to sleep in cozy warm beds.</p>
