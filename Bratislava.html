<h1> July 16th </h1>
<a id="July16"></a>


	<p> We woke up early and walked to the train station to catch a subway to the airport.</p>

	<p> I walked grandpa to his gate and got him checked in and got his assistance. Grandpa brought a little backpack and since I only have a few weeks left I traded my big bag for his little one. I went from a 20 kilo pack to a 10 kilo pack which will make a huge difference traveling. After I dropped grandpa off I started my journey to Bratislava, the Capitol of Slovakia, which took about 3 hours. Once I got to the train station I only had about a 10 minute walk to my hostel.</p>

	<p> I checked in, went upstairs and took the best nap! The hostel I stayed at opened in May and was very spacious and clean. When I woke up from my nap two of my dorm mates had just gotten back. It was two girls from Finland that are traveling together for 10 days. We went to the outdoor patio and got a few beers from the bar. While we were sitting we started talking to a group of guys and one of them ended up being the owner of the hostel. He was very curious to talk to us about what we liked and disliked about his hostel and others, he also bought us beers. We were joined by another guy from Finland and 4 guys from England. We talked about our travels, the people we had meet, and political differences in our countries. Me and the people from Finland talked a lot about the differences in schooling and professions. At 11 the patio closed because of the neighbors so we all went to bed. </p>


<h1> July 17 </h1>

	<p> I woke up early and set out to tour the city. I walked into the old town and found a place for breakfast. I went to a super american place that served bagels with bacon, egg, and cheese. I walked around for a little bit and then sat on a park bench and read my book. I am trying to figure out what book I want to read now, I'm choosing between Get a Financial Life, Never eat alone, and Wild. I like holding a real book and flipping real pages but it is really hard to find English books that I want to read. I downloaded the preview of each of the books to try and decide. </p>

	<p> At eleven I did a free walking tour of Bratislava which lasted two and a half hours. The tour guide was really good and she taught us a lot of history about the city. The tour had people from all over the world ranging from Finland to Brazil to Australia.The tour started in the square that contains the statue of Hans Christian Andersen who is a famous childrens book writter,  who wrote famous works such as The Little Mermaid.</p>

	<p> We learned a lot about the protest against communism and the history of how Slovakia was a major role in ending the communist rule. There is a famous picture that was taken in front of the Bratislavan library that helped show the world what was happening. Many people think this picture was taken in Prague. </p>

	<p>George Bush traveled to Bratislava when he was in office and gave a speech that was so good our tour guide could recite it. "From the hotel to our left, communist authorities watched thousands of candles shining in the darkness — and gave the order to extinguish them. The authorities succeeded in crushing that protest. But with their candles and prayers, the people of Bratislava lit a fire for freedom that day, a fire that quickly spread across the land. And within 20 months, the regime that drove Slovaks from this square would itself be driven from power. By claiming your own freedom, you inspired a revolution that liberated your nation and helped to transform a continent," George Bush</p>

	<p> The movie Hostel was staged in Bratislava and the guide told us that their tourism industry decreased by 75% the following year. This movie is about a hostel in Bratislava where all of the gust get chopped up into little pieces. The entire plot was made up and the man who wrote the movie had never even been to Bratislava. The city contacted him and asked if he would come and make a statement about how it is actually nice in Bratislava and he said no. </p>

	<p> n 1809, Napoleon Bonaparte was at war with the Austrian Empire under the Habsburg Monarchy. His deadly siege artillery bombarded Bratislava and left 100's of Napoleon’s cannonballs wedged in buildings around town. Currently only five can be seen and one of them is stuck in the Old Town Hall. You can see it on the left side of the pointy window.</p>

	<p> She told us that the national unemployment is 14% but in Bratislava it is only 1%. She also told us that Vienna and Bratislava are the two closest capital cities in the world. </p>

	<p> In the tour we visited Church of St, Elisabeth which is nick named the blue church. </p>

	<p> After the tour I walked to the castle that over looks the town. The castle was first constructed in the 700's and was never conquered by anyone. However, one night a bunch of Italians were in the castle having dinner and they left the stove on and burnt down the entire castle. </p>

	<p> I walked back to my hostel, grabbed my bags, and got some lunch. My train left for Budapest at 4. On the train I sat with three very nice girls who are about to start University in England. We talked the entire time and then helped each other to maneuver the metros to get to our hostels. I got to my hostel around 8 and was really hoping that it would be a really fun hostel and everyone would be pregaming, unfortunately it was silent. I wanted to go out because it was a Friday night in Budapest but I didn't meet any friends so I decided to just go to bed and meet peopletomorrow. </p>
