<h1> July 20th </h1>
<a id="July20"></a>


	<p>I originally wanted to make the 7:30 train to Prague but in the morning I wasn't really feeling that decision. I ended up taking advantage of the extra sleep and catching the 11:30 train. I woke up and walked to a near by bookstore to search for an English book. I ended up with "All The Light We Cannot See" cause the guy told me it was really good. I went to the grocery store to buy some breakfast and food for the train ride. The ride to Prague was 6 hours. For the first 3 hours I had three seats to myself and I was able to sleep the whole time. </p>

	<p> A 30 year old couple from Finland came into my car and we ended up talking for awhile. The guy was a huge history buff so explained to me a lot about Finlands history and also told me about the Cold War and explained The Korean and Vietnam war. We talked a lot about Finland and how they view different immigrants from Russia or the Middle East. </p>

	<p> I finally got to Prague at 6 and had to take the metro to my hostel. When I got to my hostel I went to a local pub/restaurant and got a full dinner and beer for $4.50. I contemplated going out but never really got motivated enough so I ended up just laying in my bed and reading my book. </p>

<h1> July 21st </h1>

	<p> I woke up and went on a free walking tour of Prague. We started out by walking through Karlovo square and stopping at one of the churches. At this church there was a room that they used to have political meetings. A long long time ago in Prague Roman Catholics were the dominant religion and then the Protestants wanted to take over the city. So one day 10 Protestants marched into the second story room where the Catholics were having a meeting and threw all of the Catholics out of the window while 10 more stood at the bottom and held spears for the bodies to land on. Apparently it was very common in Prague's history to throw people out of windows. Our next stop was the Main Street of Vaclavske which is a giant tourist shopping street.</p>

	<p>Our next stop was the old town square which is home to The Old Town Hall, the Gothic Church of Our Lady, and the John Huss statue. The Old Town holds the world famous astronomical clock that was constructed in 1410. Every hour the Apostles walk and you can see them through the windows. On the front their are four statues. The four statues represent greed, vanity, entertainment, and death. Every hour all of the statues shake their heads no, except death shakes his head yes because death is inevitable. </p>

	<p> The next thing in the square is the statue of John Huss. He  was a key predecessor to the Protestant movement of the sixteenth century. Unfortunately in 1415 he was burned alive by Roman Catholics and the statue was put in the square on the 500th anniversary of his death. </p>

	<p> The Church of our lady was built 80 meters tall, however the two towers have different circumferences. The architects claim that they built them different sizes because one is Adam and one is Eve. There is debate if the fatter one is Adam because he is stronger or Eve because she is pregnant. </p>

	<p>Our next stop was at the Jewish Quarter which is almost perfectly preserved. Hitler made sure that nothing bad happened to this area because he wanted it to be a museum for an extinct race after the end of the war. This is also home to an extremely famous Jewish cemetery which is 12 layers high. They did not have a lot of land so they just kept adding more land on top and burying people on top of people. The tour guide also told us that the Jewish memorial in Berlin was built with inspiration from this cemetery. </p>

	<p> Then we walked toward the river and heard about some different history.</p>

	<p>After the tour I got wiener schnitzel and a beer with two people I had meet at a traditional pub. When we were done with lunch we walked up to the Prague Castle and to St. Vitus Cathedral.</p>

	<p>All of the buildings were absolutely beautiful and the view of the city was perfect. </p>

	<p>Then I walked over The Charles Bridge which is the oldest bridge in Prague.</p>

	<p> I was running late for my train so ended up almost jogging a mile to the train station with all of my bags. When I got there I realized my train was delayed an hour so I had to sit on the floor and wait. I had about a 5 hour train ride and I read the entire time. I ended up reading almost 150 pages of my new book. The train I was on had no windows and no AC so it was a pretty long 5 hours. When I finally arrived in Berlin it was dark so I decided to take a taxi to my hostel. When I got to my hostel I contacts Jason, George, and Cole and told them to come to my bar for a drink. We had a drink and my hostel and then a drink at theirs and then we took a metro to the young and hip area of bars. Berlin has a crazy going out seen. The area we went to was a bunch of old warehouses covered in graffiti that the they had turned into bars and clubs. We couldn't get into any of these places because they said Cole was too young so we decided to just go to a near by bar and chill. Metros stop early on weekdays so we took a taxi home and then got some food. In Berlin you would think their authentic cuisine would be brats or wiener Shnitzel, however their traditional food is actually doner kabob. The population of Berlin is 20 percent Turkish so kabob shops are everywhere. The place we went to was absolutely delicious. </p>
