<h1> June 27th </h1>
<a id="June27"></a>

	<p> I had to wake up at 4:30 and walk to the train station. My train left Amsterdam central station at 5:10 and I got to the airport at 5:50. My flight left at 7:10. I slept almost the entire flight, I woke up right before landing and the view was beautiful. </p>

	<p>When I got to Nice I took a bus to the hotel Carters family was staying at. I got there at 10 which was exactly when they were waking up. Me Carter and his sister, Caroline, walked around Nice for a little bit. We walked up to the panorama over look which looks over the whole city. On the vacation is Carters mom (Catherine), dad (Andrew), sister (Caroline), and his dad's sister(Polly). </p>

<p></p>
	<p> We walked through the city and came across a farmers market and a lot of really cute stores. We went back to the hotel to meet his parents. We loaded all of our bags in the clown car and drove to our house in Vence, it is about a 30 minute drive from Nice. The house is breathtaking, easily the nicest place I have ever stayed. Carters dad works with the man that owns this house and the man is so generous that he lets his friends use it open weeks for free. This is a view of the patio and entrance. </p>

	<p>It is an old olive oil mill and still has many parts of the factory in it. The house is located on a river and part of the river runs through the house. The river runs through the house through the olive oil machines because it used to power them. Now it allows you to hear peacefull running water all dat.</p>

	<p>It is built into a valley it's cliffs on each side and so much greenery that no one would ever know it's there. There is a beautiful back garden with lots of fruit trees and an amazing pool. </p>

	<p>The front room is a giant open room with 2 connected family rooms and a dinning room. </p>

<p>Everything in the house is so beautifully decorated with antiques and art. Every little detail of everything is perfectly decorated. This is the main kitchen. </p>

<p>We lost count and can't remember them all but I think there are 7 rooms and the house sleeps 22 comfortably. This is what the common room looks like...</p>

	<p> There is also a giant kids room that has 3 bunk beds and 2 double beds. It also has rope swings from the ceiling for the kids to play on! </p>

<p>In the afternoon Caroline, Carter, and I walked into the old town to have lunch. I had a delicious plate of meats and cheeses accompanied with white wine.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the first night we had a cook come and make is dinner. She made us a shrimp salad, lamb with potatoes and vegetables, and then a soufflé for desert. We sat at the dinner table for 5 hours and talked and drank wine. It reminded me of my family and it was so nice.  I'm also crashing a family vacation so I've learned a lot about their extended family.

	<p>We all woke up pretty late and Caroline, Polly, and I walked into town to pick up some fresh bread and a cup of coffee.Every morning they have a street of markets that sells fresh  vegetables, fruits, meat, cheeses, and pastries. </p>

<p>When you walk into town this is the view you see, our house is in the valley of all these houses. </p>

	<p>After we got back to the house we laid by the pool and read all day. This family reads a lot so it was really nice to talk to everyone about the books they are reading and their favorite books. Actually this whole family is just really smart in general so talking is really fun because you learn so much. Around 7 we started getting ready for dinner and headed into town. We ate a very nice restaurant and I got beef cheek with gnocchi. After dinner we headed back to the house and say around and talked and drank wine.</p>

	<p> We woke up early and all piled in the family car and drove to nearby town called Saint Paul which is one of the oldest medieval towns in the French Rivera. This is a city center that is protected by a giant wall and it is beautiful!</p>

	<p> We walked through the town and looked in some of the different stores and art galleries. In the very center there is a church that we were allowed to go inside. </p>

	<p> This town is known for its modern art so they have different statues looking out over the surrounding valley. </p>

	<p> After we were done with the town we went to a modern art museum called Foundation Maeght. The current featured artist was very dark and none of us really liked his exhibit. One of the cool things in the garden was a fountain in the garden.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/588jbrq20os1xbu/Photo%20Jun%2029%2C%206%2054%2038%20PM.png?dl=0" alt="" width="400" height="400">

	<p>After the museum we came home for lunch and most of us took a long nap. We laid by the pool and hung out. The cook came again tonight to make dinner so we sat outside for 5 hours and enjoyed a multiple courses and very delicious wine. </p>


<h1>June 30th </h1>
<a id="June30"></a>

	<p> We woke up and drove an hour away to place on the coast called Cannes. Cannes is a beach town that host a very famous film festival every year. Once we got there the kids and adults separated. Hutch, Carter, Caroline, and I walked from one end of the city to the next and had lunch at a small pizzeria. We wondered the docks of all the enormous yachts and discussed what we would do with our money if we were that rich. We walked up to the old town and went inside the cathedral and looked around the castle. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/gobpycut456hilj/Photo%20Jun%2030%2C%204%2003%2026%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p>The view from the old town was looking over the entire coast and the city. </p>

	<p>After we walked around old town we headed to the beach for a little. Clothes were optional at this beach so there were lots and lots of women without bathing suit tops on. Most of them were really old and they had sat in the sun so long that their skin looked like leather. </p>


	<p> We got back to the house around 6:30 and all showered before dinner. Carters aunt and dad cooked dinner for us, it was a make your own salad with lots of different toppings. Once again we sat at the dinner table talking for hours. The main topic of conversation was wine, Carters dad knows a lot so he was teaching us a lot of different things. </p>
