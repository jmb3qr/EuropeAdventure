	<p> I woke up and went to get some breakfast. At 10:30 I meet with a group of people to do a free walking tour. There was about 40 people on the tour and it lasted for three hours. We started at St. Stephen's Bastilica and then walked down the main shopping street. The dome of St. Stephen's Bastilica is 96 meters tall and nothing in Budapest is allowed to be built any higher than that. The dome has also collapsed two times in history and had to been re-built. </p>

	<p> We walked to the giant Ferris wheel and looked at a lot of different fountains. </p>

	<p>The only problem with doing the free walking tour is that there are so many people and so much to look at it, so it is really easy to zone out the guide. Another thing that is funny is as you are walking you make friends with people in the group and start your own conversations and then when the guide starts to speak you almost feel annoyed that she is disrupting your conversation. </p>

	<p> We walked over the chain bridge to get to the Buda side. The Danube river actually splits the city in 2 and one side of the river is Pest and the other side is Buda. Buda is the more residential side and is much more expensive and Pest is the young and fun side. A man traveled all over Europe looking at different bridges to see what styles he liked best. He ended up building The chain bridge after a bridge in London. The bridge has two lions lions on each side of it guarding it and keeping it safe. </p>

	<p> On the Buda side there is the Royal Palace, </p>

	<p> the Matthias church, </p>

	<p> and the Liberty statue. The view from the statue is a lot better than the statue itself. </p>

	<p> You can look across the river and see the Parliment of Budapest. </p>

	<p> By the time the tour ended I had been talking to the same people for about two hours. There was a 22 year old girl named Mackenzie from Canada and a 26 year old guy named David from Pennsylvania. Mackenzie and I were very like minded and got along really well. When the tour ended we walked around together and then went for a late lunch and some drinks at a locals restaurant. </p>

	<p> David is currently doing some soul searching. He graduated from college and then went to Puerto Rico to teach English. After 2 years of working he quit and started traveling. He has been traveling for 13 months and has been in Hawaii, Australia, Israel, Pakistan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and all over Europe. He had a lot of good stories and insight. When he was in Australia he went to live in a hippy village for a few days. 15 hippies have developed a little village in a valley in Kuia where they live generally off the land. He said that they don't ware clothes and that there was a 5 year old kid that had never been into the city. </p>

	<p> My friends were supposed to get into Budapest at 8 so I went back to the hostel and relaxed and waited for them. The friends are Jason, George, and Cole. Jason is one of Scott's friends and Cole and George I know because they are a few years younger than me. They ended up getting there a little late but I meet them at their hostel and then went to dinner with them. That night we were going to a giant party in one of the thermal baths. These thermal baths are about the size of a football field and thousands of people go on Saturday nights. The pools are all lit up and there are light shows and djs. This was definitely not the cleanest thing I've ever done but it was a good experience. </p>

	<p> On Friday night when I wanted to make friends and there was no one in my hostel, I went on tinder and swiped right to every American looking guy. I ended up matching with four guys from Boston University who were all staying together in Budapest. By the time I talked to them they had already gone out but they told me they were going to the baths the next night. Out of the thousands of people at the bath I ended up running into them and my friends and them got along really well. </p>

	<p> Once the bath party was over we started walking back to our hostel but half way realized we wanted a taxi. We got some late night food and they walked me back to my hostel. </p>

<h1> July 19th </h1>

	<p> I woke up and had to organize all of my travels for the next week. After I had planned and booked my hostels I left to get some lunch. I went to a street food market that is only open on Sunday's and got a traditional Hungarian meal. It is a fried circular piece of dough with sour cream, cheese, and arugula on it and it was pretty good. After lunch I walked around and went in different hipster shops. I went to another market and ended up buying a leather purse from a lady. Everything here is so much cheaper than it is in America! I continued to walk up and down the streets and when I was hot I would stop and put my feet in one of the fountains. In Budapest fountains are public places for sitting taking your shoes off and putting your feet in the water. There is one man fountain/ pond in the center of Pest that everyone goes to to hang out at. </p>

	<p> I went back to St. Stephen's Bastilica and climbed the stairs to the top of the dome. The view from up there was absolutely beautiful! </p>

	<p> I walked back to my hostel so that I could get some wifi and see what the guys plan were. Me and Jason meet at the fountain and got dinner and some drinks. We went back to their hostel to pick up George and Cole. Their hostel was doing a pub crawl on Saturday night so we waited around for it to start and went to a cute place near by. </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/c2xy66duy1gflc5/Photo%20Jul%2019%2C%209%2046%2031%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p>The pub crawl was a group of about 50 people and we went to three different pubs and then a club. Budapest is known for their ruin pubs which are these really old buildings that are not allowed to be renovated so they were turned into ancient bars. These bars are super eclectic and have random stuff all over the ceilings and walls. </p>

	<p> At the first bar we meet two american guys that we ended up talking to all night. They both went to school at University of California Santa Barbara and were 26. Ramine works for Lift and Omie is an accountant for UC Santa Barbara. Both of their parents are from Iran and came to America as refugees. Ramine was a genius, no matter what the topic of conversation was he knew everything about it. Omie was also very smart but he was much quieter. They knew everything about professional sports from the date of specific games to the names of every player. They were also extremely educated on the economy and politics. </p>

	<p>Omie wore pants out but it was so hot every where that at one of the bars they got scissors and cut off the bottom part of his pants. </p>

	<p> We talked a lot about political and social issues, and it was so good to listen to them and learn. We discussed Greece, ISIS, and the race issues in America. Some of the guys ended up getting in pretty heated arguments over the things but I just sat and listened. </p>

	<p> Budapest is known for being a very sketchy place so you have to be on your toes the whole time. At one of the bars Jason started talking to a girl and me and Cole didn't think she seemed legit. Her and her friend were claiming to be English tourist however when I was in the bathroom I overheard them talking in a non English language. The girl kept doing sketchy things through the night and it became a giant group debate all night on if she was telling the truth or not. The night kind of turned weird pretty quickly, walking down the streets with our group of 50 there were a bunch of guys following us and trying to sell people drugs. Once we got to the final club we were all so sketched out that we ended up just going back home. Once you get in a mind set of everyone is trying to rob or steal me it is really hard to get out of it. As we were getting food I think we all realized that we had been over reacting all night and all the people we were with were probably good people. But, it was definitely better to be safe than sorry though. </p>
