<h1> July 5th </h1>
<a id="July5"></a>

	<p> We had to wake up at 5:30 to walk to the train station. We took a train from Interlaken to La Spiez, Switzerland and then from la Spiez to Milan. Milan is having an expo this week which is something where people from all over the world come to show off their goods and it's also a big party. Our train was insane with all the people on their way to the expo. Our next train was from Milan to La Spezia. I sat in a room with 4 other Americans. A couple from New York, the husband was a psychiatrist and a musician and the wife worked for the largest environmental protection nonprofit. The other couple was a young couple from Miami who both do sales for the same company. In our three hour ride we learned everything about what they do, where they live, and their travel plans. When I got into the room on the train there was no more room for my luggage so I put it in the room next door. When we were almost to La Spezia I saw a punk kid walking off the train with my bag, I ran to him and grabbed the bag and said this is mine. He started screaming in Italian and I took the bag and walked back to my room. So basically I almost got robbed and was super lucky I happened to be looking in that direction at that specific time he walked by. It was definitely lesson learned to keep my things within sight and reach.</p>

	<p> Cinque Terre is 5 cities on the North West coast of Italy. The order of the towns from North to South is Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, Riomaggiore, and then you get to La Spieza. The couple I was sitting with told me it would be easier to get off at Monterosso and take the train to Riomaggiore, where we were staying. They were wrong, we got off at Monterosso and got on another train, but we missed our stop and ended up in La Spezia anyway, and then the next train to Riomaggiore was not for an hour. But we finally got there!</p>

	<p> We got to the main office of our hostel and were lead to the room we were staying in. We stayed in an apartment that had 2 bedrooms, each with a queen and 4 twin beds. There were people sleeping everywhere and hey we're all very normal but people generally kept to themselves. We were so excited to be there because we had been traveling for 13 hours. We walked down to the Main Street and got some take away food. I got fresh noodles with pesto and we bought a bottle of wine and went down to the cliffs to watch the sunset and eat. As soon as we got down there we met a kinda odd kid named Zach from Seattle. There was a group of guys who were about to go on a big boat for a sunset cruise and they asked us if we wanted to go. Me and Kelsey were discussing it and another guy came over to us and said you girls are safe here. His name was Valentino and it was very very nice of him to look out for us. We started talking to him and his 2 friends, Elvis and Mickey. Elvis had gone to buy a bottle of wine and on his way down he saw some friends he had made the day before and told them to come down. The people that came down was the Risley family from Sacramento. It was a mom (Kari), dad(Jeff), an 18 year old daughter Josie, and a 20 year old daughter Jordan. The 10 of us hung out all night. </p>

	<p>Elvis, Mickey, and Valentino are all from Albania. Elvis is cousins with Mickey on his moms side and Valentino on his dad's side. Elvis's dad owns a car mechanic shop and Valentinos dad owns a construction company in La Spezia. Valentinos dad moved back to Albania so now he is the boss or general manager. Elvis and Valentino moved to Albania when they were 14 to find work. Mickey stayed in Albania to finish school and now he is on scholarship at University of Milan to study medicine. Mickey also speaks seven languages Albanian, Italian, English, German, Turkish, French, and Spanish. We joked that he was the brains of the operation and Elvis and Valentino were the looks. Valentino and Elvis were not very good at English so they looked to Mickey for a lot of translation.</p>

	<p> The way Elvis meet the Risley family is because the day before he was jumping off a huge cliff and they stopped him to talk to him cause they thought it was so cool. I absolutely love jumping off things into the water so when I saw what they were doing I wanted to so bad! I didn't have a bathing suit but Jordan went to her room and got one that I could borrow! I jumped of the 15 meter cliff and it was Awesome! </p>

	<p>So awesome that I did it about 10 more times throughout the night. On my last jump I wasn't paying attention and landed on my butt a little and it hurt so bad! </p>

	<p> When we were done jumping off the cliffs we walked up to a ledge to watch the sunset. </p>

	<p>By the end of the night we had all learned a lot about each other. Jeff manages ticket sales for the Sacramento Kings and by the end of the night had had a little to much wine and ended up offering Zach a job. We all went swimming at night and ended up with cuts from climbing on the rocks. Valentino had to catch the last train to La Spezia because he had to work at 5 in the morning, but Elvis and Mickey stayed with a friend in Riomaggiore. Me and Kbow walked up a billion stairs to get to our hostel. </p>


<h1> July 6th </h1>
<a id="July6"></a>

	<p> I had to wait until 9 till I was allowed to wake up Kelsey. When I woke up I could barely sit down because my butt hurt so bad from jumping off the cliffs. It's so weird but I guess the impact over and over to the same place made me tail bone super soar. We got breakfast in Riomaggiore and then took a train to Monterosso.</p>

	<p> You usually hike between all 5 towns but only one trail was open due to rock slides. We hiked from Monterosso to Vernazza, it was super hot and really steep, Kelsey was miserable the whole time.</p>

	<p> The views along the walk were absolutely beautiful. </p>

	<p>Once we got to Vernazza Kelsey needed food, water, and a nap so she layed on the beach while I walked around a little and then I joined her. </p>

	<p> We took a train to the next town, Corniglia. There wasn't much in this town so we walked to one of the terraces overlooking the sea and enjoyed a glass of Sangria, the terrace was filled with interesting people. There was a couple from Australia with their newborn little girl and one of their parents. The young couple had just lived in Dubai for 10 years and was moving back to Sydney. There was a couple who had just left Denver to move to San Francisco and there were two girls who were spending 6 weeks traveling Europe together. We talked about all the things an adult international group would talk about (quality of life in the work place, healthcare, how the financial crises affected each place, and property value in booming cities). Everything was very interesting to listen to and discuss. </p>

	<p> We left Corniglia and took a train back to Riomaggiore. We layed on the rocks and read our books and then walked to pick up dinner. I got an olive assortment and gnocchi with pesto sauce. We walked back down to the water to eat and ran into Mickey. We went to the rocks with Mickey and one by one meet up with Elvis, Valentino, Jeff, Kari, Josie, and Jordan. Once again we had. Great night sitting on the rocks and watching the sunset. </p>

	<p> I spent a lot of time talking to Valentino about his work. He is the boss in La Spezia and absolutely loaded in Albania. He said his family has a house on the cliffs with their own private beach in Albania. His construction company just got a huge contract to build a 10 story hotel in Puerto Vierto.  He said the contract was for the next six years. He told me that his cousin works in construction in Colorado Springs and he has a work visa to move there in September to work for him. Keep in mind this entire conversation was in English / Spanish. His English is only okay but since I know Spanish and he knows Italian we were able to communicate largely in Spanish. </p>

	<p> I also talked to Mickey a lot about his plans. He is on a full scholarship to study and one of the best Universities in Europe and he doesn't come from very much in Albania. He told me that he has so many girls a day contacting him trying to start a relationship because they all know he is going to be wealthy and they want to get out  of the life they live in Albania. He told me that Mickey and Valentino come from a social class that people say "Money is just another piece of paper to them." </p>

	<p> We took a girls picture, a boys picture, and a kids picture with all of our new friends. </p>

	<p></p>

	<p> This entire time me and Kelsey were talking all about our parents and telling everyone how badly we wished they were there. We all walked into the town together and sat at the one place we had wifi to do our daily phone check. We all parted ways and went to bed.</p>

<h1> July 7th </h1>
<a id="July7"></a>

	<p> we woke up at 9 and I started to pack my stuff, I needed a place to store my bag for the day so we went to the Risleys apartment and had breakfast with them and saw if I could leave my bags there. They were going to be in a different town all day so I had to leave my luggage at the train station. Kelsey and I took the train to Manarola we walked around the city and then picked up lunch.</p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/iffbtujdax49s04/phpUyMshBPM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400">

	<p> I got bread, cheese, artichokes, and salami and Kelsey got mixed fried fish. We took it down to one of the cliffs to sit and eat.</p>

	<p> I swam a little bit and then read my book. </p>

	<p>At 2 I had to catch my train to go to Florence and meet up with my grandpa! The train was miserable because my tail bone still hurts so bad that I can only sit in one way and even that hurts. </p>

	<p> Grandpa was supposed to get into Florence around 3 and I had given him directions to take a taxi to the hotel. I am not able to communicate over here without wifi so I was just hoping everything went as planned. I arrived in Florence at 6 and had directions to get to our Air bnb, I got lost, but when I made it grandpa was there waiting! </p>

	<p> We got a reservation from the lady that runs our bed and breakfast and went out to dinner. On our walk to dinner we somehow ran into one of the couple's I was on the train with! What are the chances of that! They had heard me talk about traveling with grandpa so they were excited to meet him. We talked for awhile and then parted ways. Our dinner was in a very nice quite Italian place. After dinner we walked around and then headed back to our bed and breakfast to go to sleep. </p>
