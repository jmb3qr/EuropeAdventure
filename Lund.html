	<p> We had class all morning, this is our classroom building, it’s called IIIE International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics. </p>

	<p> After lecture we went to a really cute cafe called Ebbas, it was delicious </p>

		<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wrwx0i25a1fh9dc/phpXHFo7VAM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p> We went to the city municipality building and learned about the structure of their government and city planning, this is a view from the top of the city building. In Sweden the central government does not have many duties. The country is split up into municipalities and these local governments run everything. One of our groups of students is working with Lund Municipality to help make the delivery of goods into the city center more efficient. </p>

	<p> The head of transportation for Lund is a man name Anders and he gave us a presentation on the overview of the municipality. One thing really interesting was that you can be elected to city council as an 18 year old and Anders told us that "Lund has 8 political parties from conservative to communist." Then the owner of Bike Kitchen in Malmo came for the initial consulting meeting for my team for the Bike Library, <a href="http://www.cykelbiblioteket.se/om-cykelbiblioteket/">this is the website for the company</a>  . After that meeting we walked back, had dinner, and hung out all night on the balcony. It was 40 degrees and raining sideways but we still were out on the porch. We attempted to go to a bar called Hercules but were unsuccessful at getting in because in Lund only one thing happens a night. This means that every person was trying to go to the same bar, and we were not the top priority. Lund is absolutely beautiful, here is one of my favorite pictures from the first day. </p>

	<p> Today we had off all day because it is ascension day, most of us walked around town all day, we had lunch together at Ebbas. These are two of the churches in town, this is a historical viking town so the buildings are very beautiful.</p>

	<p> Another thing we did was attempt to go to a contemporary art museum. It was closed but we got to look around all of the art outside. </p>

	<p> At Lund University instead of having fraternities they have these things called Nations. There are about 15 Nations and anyone can join any Nation as long as you pay a monthly fee. A Nation has rooms where people sleep and then some have a bar, restaurant, and club. Nations have all different events and any student of Lund can go to any event at the Nations. They serve lunch and dinner at a discounted rate and have themed parties. If you work at a nation you can build up credit so you don’t have to pay the membership fees or cover charges. Last night we went to Lund Nation which has a rooftop bar and restaurant. This is the view from the top. </p>

	<p> After Lund Nation we went to Ostgota Nation for a club, we were told to go early to avoid lines, but we were there for 2 hours before people showed up. </p>

	<p> We had lectures all morning and then went to visit one of the project worksites. This worksite is a cultural development center in Lund. It has space for all different types of activities and is built in an old warehouse. The warehouse has rooms for different acting programs and spaces for people to practice and perform their talents. In addition its free space for different groups of people to work on projects. In the front of the building is a cafe space for people to meet and relax. </p>

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/g6lqt589prvxeh3/phpux98vjAM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p> One of the projects we learned about was a virtual reality tech project, they put cameras on different people such as beggars and refuges. They then take all of these clips and make a inspiring video to show to kids, so kids learn how people struggle. This maker space also collects used clothes and has sewing machines and people can take any clothes for free and remake whatever they want.They also have 3D printers machines for metal work and wood work. This idea was amazing and I hope these spaces spread to America. This is a picture of us in the outdoor warehouse where they let anyone graffiti. This space focuses on reusing, so they have bathtubs that they turned into above ground gardens, and turn old things int art, like this bike. </p>

	<p> On Friday night we went to Kalmer nation for dinner and drinks and then we went to Holland nation for a party. We ended up running into a few students we had meet previous nights. It was a lot of fun and we all made a lot of friends. Only nation members can hang out in the dorm part of the buildings, and in there rooms the kids have different themed pregames. It is funny to show up and have everyone dressed up as different things. Undergrads and grad students are all members of the same nations. This particular night was all of the seniors last night of medschool so they all wore their white coats to celebrate 5 years since their white coat ceremony. </p>

	<p> Today was pretty uneventful, we went to class and worked on our client projects. After work and class I went in search of local second hand stores. I found an awesome one in a basement and got a pair of high top converses for 8 dollars! I probally would have found a lot more things I wanted but the lady closed the store and made me leave. </p>

	<p> While passing the central train station I took a picture of all of the bikes that are stored there. It looks like they go on forever. Locals told us that keeping your bike there is a terrible idea because they will get stolen. </p>

	<p>We had lectures all morning and then we broke for lunch. During lunch a few of us toured the main cathedral in the town square. They are not positive when this cathedral was constructed but Bishop Asser Thorkilsson became the first archbishop for all of Scandinavia in 1104 and the cathedral was begun sometime after he took office. The building was constructed in the typical basilica style with half-rounded arches supporting a flat timber ceiling, and made of sandstone. Lund became the religious heart of Denmark and over the years many monasteries, nunneries, priories sprang up around the cathedral.</p>

	<p>After lunch we went to the municipality office and Anders finally gave us our own bikes! Up until now we were using a bike share system called lundahoj, but the bikes were not very nice. We acted like little kids on Christmas, we were so excited to ride our new bikes. We did client work all day and had meetings with our professors about the progression of our projects. </p>

	<p>This is a picture of some of the flowers on the way to the municipality building. The tulips are beautiful right now. </p>

	<p> We worked on our projects all morning, my group worked to finish all of our surveys and get them on survey monkey. We started to think about how we were going to design our analysis tools. In the afternoon we traveled to Malmö to meet with Bertil. After our meeting he let us try out a few more of the bikes. This is a picture of him showing us the electric cargo bike. </p>

	<p>When we got back to Lund there was a huge event going on. The winner of Eurovision was making his first stop in Lund. The Eurovision Song Contest is the longest running annual TV song competition and has been running for over 60 years and involves 52 countries. Each member, or invited, country submits a song to be performed on live television and radio and then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the most popular song in the competition. It is also one of the most watched non-sporting events in the world, with audience figures having been quoted in recent years as anything between 100 million and 600 million internationally. Winning the Eurovision Song Contest provides an opportunity for the winning artists to capitalize on the surrounding publicity and further their careers. You can watch the winning song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sGOwFVUU0I">here</a>. The city square was absurd last night with half the town there to see. This is a picture of the crowd from 100 yards  away from the stage. </p>

	<p> We did project work all morning, then had 2 lectures. The first lecture was about urban sprawling, the guy pretty much showed us graph after graph about how America sucks. This is an image illustrating the difference between Atlanta and Barcelona. </p>

		<img src="http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/atlanta_and_barcelona.png" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

 	<p> We came to the conclusion that urban sprawl in the US is due to the American dream of having your own house with your own front yard and picket fence. He showed us a cool study of how people perceive they are surrounded by more green space when they live in a city than in a suburb. This study is based on the fact that green space in a city is carefully planned out and therefore gets more use. The second lecture was about living labs and how they are the only means of effective research and planning for the future. </p>

	<p> I’ve learned a lot about grocery shopping in foreign countries, don’t be afraid to ask someone for help... As you may know they do not sell cans of pasta sauce here or packets of alfredo sauce (now I understand why my foreign exchange student put ketchup on her pasta). I wanted pasta so I went to the store to buy the ingredients for alfredo sauce, I needed butter, crème, and Parmesan. I made it home with butter, sour cream, and mozzarella. It was interesting pasta sauce. </p>

	<p> We did project work all morning and my team meet with our client in the afternoon. We had a few little things to talk about before we finished our analytical tool. He brought us fika which included cinnamon rolls and coffee so we were happy campers. After our meeting I rushed to the train station because I had arranged to meet Kelsey there at 4:30, I waited for an hour until I finally received a message over Wi-Fi "Jeannie save me, I’m at station." It’s crazy to thing that just 10 years ago people actually had to rely on concrete plans for meeting places. After we found each other I showed her around the city and we went to dinner together. Then she went back to Copenhagen and I went to work on my report. </p>

	<p> My team had finished our data analytics tool and me and jasmine decided to take over and make it pretty. I created a super easy home screen interface with buttons to all the different analysis pages, to allow Bertil to navigate through the tool. We broke our results into 4 main categories demographics, service, infrastructure, and behavior. Me and jasmine spent hours organizing each of these pages and making all of the graphs easy to process. <p>

<a id="May28"></a>

	<p> On Thursday we had a long day of project work and presentation preparation. We did run throughs with our professors so we could get feedback. One of the teams presented to the Lund Municipality head of traffic.This is team Anders, their project was to study the flow of delievery trucks through the city in an effort to come up with a way to decrease the traffic in the city. They are trying to figure out how drops off can be better scheduled to decrease a trucks time in the city. They recommended that Anders make relationships with all of the shop owners in an effort to persuade them to better follow the rules for drop off times. </p>

<a id="May29"></a>

	<p> Today was the day! We all woke up early to do a few last minute run through of our presentation. All of our clients, lecturers from Lund University, and masters students from IIEEE came to watch our presentations. They were all extremely impressed with our projects and our presentations skills. Many of the students and lecturers approached after to tell us all how good of job we did. After my groups presentation we sat down with Bertil and let him follow our directions to import the data into our tool in excel. He thought that our tool was very user friendly and was extremely thankful for everything we did for him. This is a screen shot of home screen of our analysis tool. This is a picture of my group with Bertil</p>

	<p>This is team Godsinlösen and they worked for a company called Godsinlösen that collects damaged white goods and refurbishes them. They are partners with a shipping company and the shipping company gives them any white goods that got damaged in the shipping process. This team focused on making a database to track how much CO2 Godsinlösen is saving by refurbishing these goods. To do this they had to research the production and usage data for over 20 different items such as washers, dryers, and dishwashers. </p>

	<p>This is team Stenkrossen, they worked at a makers space in Lund. This makers space is under a lot of pressure from the municipality to attract people. This space was transformed from an old factory and it sits on very valuable land. The city wants to tear this down and build apartments and in order for Stenkrossen to stay they must get very successful very fast. This team worked to identify if the public had ever heard of this space and if they had why they did not attend the makers space. This team delivered a plan for Stenkrosen to attempt to reach the most people possible based on gender, age, and where people live. </p>

	<p> After we were done with our presentations we all grabbed lunch and returned our bike to the municipality building. We then got on a train and went to a castle! The castle is called Bosjökloster and is located a little bit north of Lund. This castle was built in 1080 and was originally a nunnery, in the 16th century it was transformed to a castle by the Danish government. It was then donated to the former arch bishop of Lund under the condition that he would take care of the nuns. In 1560 the Danish government was trying to consolidate all of the land they owned to the center of Denmark. In order to do this they made trades with people, people who owned land in the center would trade their land for Danish owned land outside of the city. A women become owner of this castle through one of these trades. Currently this castle is owned and shared by a couple of families. </p>

	<p> The palace is open to the public for free and is home to an art gallery/museum and a park. The art museum had a lot of very pretty paintings and sculptures. They have a bunch of farm animals that are all extremely friendly so visitors can play with the animals. They had alpacas, goats, horses, pigs, and chickens. These pictures speak for how much fun we had with these animals. In addition to animals there are a lot of different gardens on the estate and a playground for children. This estate is on a lake and they provide row boats for visitors to take out. </p>

	<p> After touring the entire castle we had a nice sit down dinner with our clients and professors in an old horst stable that was converted to a ball room. After dinner we went back to Lund to celebrate our last night in Sweden. We all went back to the dorm to pregame and then we went to a shot bar. This bar in Lund is completely devoted to all different types of shots that incorporate a lot of random things. It was an extremely happy time and every one was so excited to celebrate the work we had done and the friends we made. </p>
