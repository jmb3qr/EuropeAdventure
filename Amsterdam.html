<h1> June 24th </h1>

	<p>When I got to Amsterdam Nadine, Aims, and Nadine’s dad picked me up from the airport and drove us to Nadines aunts. Here house is almost a mansion in the center of Amsterdam. She lives two blocks from their version of central park and this is her view from her front door.</p>

	 <p>The house was 4 stories with a beautiful backyard. Nadine’s aunt was so nice! We spent so much time sitting and talking to her and she was so friendly and welcoming. Aims, Nadine, and I slept on the top floor and it was the cutest room. It had a pink canopy that hung over the bed and it was like sleeping in a fairytale!</p>

	<p>We woke up and had a Dutch breakfast. In Holland they eat chocolate and sprinkles for breakfast. They have two different types of sprinkles chocolate and fruit. I had a piece of toast with chocolate sprinkles and it was a delicious breakfast. After we ate we went to Rijks museum which is the largest and most important national museum in the Netherlands. There was a bunch of different paintings and artifacts. It is most famous for its painting called The Night Watch which was painted in 1640. The Night Watch painting is famous because it was the first painting to show the soldiers interacting and not having them sitting and looking orderly.</p>

<p>Outside of the Rijks museum is one of the giant I am Amsterdam sings.</p>

	<p>It is also famous for the way the artist used the paint to show the light and shadows. Another thing I learned is why Holland’s national color is orange. The man known as the “father of their country,” is Willem van Oranje and their color became orange because of his last name.</p>


	<p>Buildings in Amsterdam were built tilting a little forward for two reasons. The first reason is so the building looks bigger when you are standing on the street and the second reason is so things would not hit the house when they were hosted to the top by the pulleys on the beams.  In addition to the buildings being tilted forward they are also falling over and sinking because the levies that they were built on are constantly moving.</p>

	<p>After the Rijks museum we walked all around Amsterdam and looked around in cute boutiques. After we walked around we sat down on one of the canals for lunch. They call outdoor seating areas terraces. We sat for a few hours and enjoyed delicious open faced sandwiches and Chardonnay.</p>

	<p>After lunch we went on a canal boat and took a tour of all of Amsterdam and learned a lot of little bits of information. We got off the boat at the Heineken experience museum but by the time we got there they were closed for the day so we just went back to Nadine’s to rest a little before dinner. </p>

	<p>We went to a little Italian restaurant for dinner and then went to a terrace to meet one of Nadine’s friends. We sat outside and talked for hours. She couldn’t go out because she has an exam next week so when she went home we went to the next place.</p>

	<p>As we were walking we ran into Nadine’s friend and then followed them to another place. We ended up not getting in and headed to another place. As we were walking two guys over heard us speaking English and screamed “AMERICANS!” We stopped to talk to these guys and they told us that they were trying to find something to do but hadn’t meet anyone cool. We told them that they could go with us to the next place. Both of the guys were from Salt Lake City, Utah and grew up together. Zeke goes to school at University of Arizona and Alex goes to school at University of Utah and they are traveling with Zekes brother and his brother’s friend. When we got to where we were going they wouldn’t let us in because we were American. The local places they want to keep local so if anyone is not Dutch than the bouncers lie and say that it’s a private party. This happened to us at the next 10 places. We ended up running into Aim’s two friends and hanging out with them the rest of the night. The 7 of us finally got in somewhere and spent the whole night having a great time and becoming best friends. </p>

<p>We all left together and attempted to get food. We ended up walking almost 30 minutes to the only bakery in town that was open. </p>

<h1>June 26 </h1>
<a id="June26"></a>

	<p> We woke up early and attempted to go to the Anne Frank house, we got there before it opened and the line was already probably 300 people long…. So we said no way and went to a café for breakfast. We took advantage of waking up and walked around the city.

	<p>After breakfast we went to the Heineken experience and it was so cool! The museum was totally interactive and had a lot of fun games that you could play.</p>

<p> After the Heineken tour we went back to Nadine’s and enjoyed a delicious lunch with the family. Nadine and Aims had been amazing tour guides!</p>

	<p> Nadine and Aims had to go back home which is about 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, so I went to meet up with Zeke and Alex.  They have a really nice Air bnb near the main train station and I have to be at the main train station at 5am so they are letting me keep my stuff here and then go to the station at 5. Aims had to go to a doctor’s appointment but after her appointment she came back into Amsterdam and meet me at Zeke’s and Alex’s. The four of us went to a very traditional Dutch dinner where we had meatballs with mashed potatoes/ sour croute. After dinner we went from bar to bar, ranging from sketchy emo bars to Dutch karaoke bars. We sat in a park for a while and hung out and then went into a club.  We got late night food at Burger King and then got a taxi home around 3:30.</p>
