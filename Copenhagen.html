<h1>May 22</h1>

	<p>Woke up early and headed to Copenhagen for the day, we meet Bertil who is the man running bicycle library. The purpose of the bike library is to get more bikes on the road and less cars by encouraging people to bike further and more often. In order to do this he is attracting families who have been discussing a cargo bike over the dinner table or business men who are discussing electric bikes, but are unsure of the investment. He is providing them a service to “borrow” these bikes for two weeks to see if they change their life and alter their behaviors. He came to us to come up with metrics that would allow him to measure the success of his business. In order for us to learn more about the demographics of cargo bikes and the concerns people have with them, Bertil wanted us to visit Butchers and Bikes because they are the “Best”. </p>	

	<p>He gave us a walking tour on the way to us <a href="http://www.butchersandbicycles.com/">Butchers and Bikes</a>. Butchers and Bikes is located in the old meatpacking district, known as kodbyen. They have turned this area into a meeting place for young people by putting different markets, bars, restaurants, and clubs there. </p>
	
<p>Butchers and Bikes has transformed the idea of a cargo bike and was started by 3 civil engineers a few years ago. You’re probably thinking how cool can a cargo bike be? The answer is AWESOME!!!! They have engineered it to perfection and are very very successful. They are expanding all over the world and have to slow down because they cannot keep up with the demand. </p>

	<p>After we left Butchers and Bikes we went to a little café to meet and talk to Bertil about our project. After our meeting he lead us to one of his favorite restaurants for lunch, he described this as being a place he takes his kids for breakfast and then goes back for scotch with his friends at night. After dinner me and a friend grabbed a gyro and some beers and walked around the city. </p>

	<p>I was supposed to meet my roommate and her mom but their flight was delayed and they missed their connection so I ended up checking in without them and spending a couple hours relaxing till they got her. </p>

<h1>May 23</h1>

	<p>We woke up early and did a guided food tour around Copenhagen, the tour started at Torvehallerne which is kind of like a farmers market. There is a building for meats and cheeses and then a building for wine and sweets. Next we toured one of the botanical gardens called Botanisk Have and walked through the different green houses.</p>

	<p>At the next stop we got to try a bunch of different open faced sandwhiches that had very eccentric things on them. During our walk from place to place we passed extremely beautiful scenery.</p>

	<p>On busy streets in Copenhagen they have these counters that track how many people hae ridden their bike passed that point so far in the day. At 1 in the afternoon almost 5,000 people had ridden by. </p>

	<p> The next stop we toured a brewery called Noerrebro Bryggeri. This brewery was started in 2003 by ex-Carlesberg brewmaster Anders Kissmeyer. He left Carlesberg because he wanted to be more creative with the type of beers he was making, we got to tast different beers and then purchase the one we liked the best for the road. In Denmark there are no open container laws so on a nice day almost every person you see is walking around with a beer in their hand. </p>

	<p>After the food tour we were exhausted and went back to take a little nap. This was on our walk back to our apartment. </p>

	<p>Kelsey and her mom had to go to the airport to try and track down their lost luggage. For dinner we went to an amazing restaurant in the meatpacking district called Pate Pate. It was a wine bar and tapa style so we each picked multiple different small portions. </p>

	<p>After dinner we went back to the apartment and hung out for a little bit. Me and Kelsey went to meet up with all of the other kids in my program who were staying in an apartment nearby. We left for the trek of going out and made it the bar all together. However, quickly after people began to fulfill their own agendas and our big group got split up into a lot of little groups. Me Kelsey and two other guys ended up going to a club called A Bar (Australian Bar), it was massive with multiple bars and dance floors. We enjoyed each other’s company until it was light out, and took the metro back to our apartments. </p>

	<p>Kelseys mom was nice enough to let us sleep in, she even went to the store and returned with breakfast for us. We rented bikes and toured Copenhagen all afternoon. We started by walking through the national cathedral of Denmark which is known as the Church of Our Lady. </p>

		<img src=" https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7vtqjl0o4q6hdry/phpwpTjHYAM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>We continued riding and stopped at The Church of our Savior, which is the one where the steeple looks like a unicorn’s horn. You can walk spiral stairs all the way to the top but there was a long line and we were on a time crunch so we couldn’t wait. We went to Christina which is a commune in the city that has gone through the process to make themselves a different state. They are known for their acceptance of drugs, drug dealer guy stand outside these little booths with black hoodies and sunglass on, they look extremely sketchy. While inside Christina you are not allowed to take any pictures, but I got one of the mural at the entrance. </p>

 	<p>Next we went to Copenhagen street food which was awesome. This is a warehouse on shipping dock that has converted itself to a food boutique. Inside the warehouse all different types of foods have stands that they sell freshly made food. </p>

		<img src=" https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1ob29zoo7t1ox1o/Photo%20May%2024%2C%204%2017%2027%20PM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>Outside on the shipping dock is an extremely lively space for people to relax and hang out. There are hundreds of reclining lawn chairs that face the sun for people to sit on.</p>

		<img src=" https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jupnvivsdxz4fld/phpx1BVkaAM.jpg?dl=0" alt="" width="600" height="400"> 

	<p>After street food we rode our bikes to the little mermaid sculpture that guards the port and then continued riding to look at the Queen’s Palace and the domes church of Copenhagen. Unfortunately we did not have enough to time to go inside because our bikes had to be back at six. We made one last stop at Nyhavn and enjoyed a beer to end my trip in Copenhagen. We rushed back to return the bikes only to find out the guy told us the wrong time, on Sunday it closes at 4, so after rushing all day we were still late. </p>

	<p>We got some gelato and I started my public transportation journey home. Copenhagen metro to Copenhagen train, Copenhagen Train to Copenhagen Airport, Train from Airport to Lund, walk from Lund Central station to my bike, and finally bike back to my dorm. </p>
