<h1> May 17th </h1>

	<p> This morning we all rode bikes to the train station at 11, we took a train from Lund to Malmö, and then we took a bus from Malmö central station to a spa called Ribersborgs kallbadhus. This was a very interesting experience. The boys and girls split up and the idea of the spa is to go in a sauna with a bunch of naked old people and then when you get tired of the spa you go and jump in the Baltic Sea (yes it is 40 degrees here) after you jump in the sea you sit outside (yes there are 20 mph winds) once you get cold you get back in the spa and repeat. After the saunas we had a brunch there that was a slightly traditional brunch with beat sauce, open faced sandwiches, and pickled herring. One thing that blew my mind about this is that this dock is build in an inlet and so the land jets out next to it. Anybody that is on the beach parallel to the dock could get a pair of binoculers and look at so many naked people! We came back to the dorm and all took naps. Now some people are doing dinner and a movie in our class room while others are catching up on some work. </p>

	<p>We had to take the bus to the train station, the train to malmo, and the bus to Stpln which is a makers space. At Stpln we got a tour of all of the facilities including the makers space, bike kitchen, kids area, screen printing space, and sewing space. This is the link to <a href="http://stpln.se/">Stpln's website.</a> The idea of a makers space was started at MIT and it was initally an idea for tech start ups to work together. However much more happens at these places then just technicle projects. In europe they are becoming entire communities for all different forms of creativity. The childrens portion of this makers space was amazing, every thing was so neatly organized with so much to design, it made you just want to sit at the little table and play.</p>

	<p>After our tour we sat down with our client Bertil and talked over our ideas. After getting feedback from him we worked at Stpln all day. We walked around malmo for a little and then headed back to lund. This is a picture of a lighthouse that looks over the harbor in malmo. </p>

 	<p>I spent the night working on the new features of the blog, hope you think there fabulous.</p>

	<p> Me and Matt, our TA, woke up early and rode our bikes to a nearby field to do a sprint workout. After our work out we had a 2 sets of lecturers. The second lecturer was really good, he talked about sustainability in the city and showed us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAkdWUjdJyA">this video</a>, I thought this was a super clever video on Stockholm. After lunch we traveled to Malmö to visit a waste management facility called Sysav. Sysav is one of the leader’s in sustainable waste management and was started in 1974. Last year Sysav treated a million tons worth of waste. They have broken their own record every year since 74 except in 2008 during the recession. We got a bus tour of the entire land fill and got to see the incineration part. This giant claw picks up 6 tons of trash in every hand full. Every handful provides enough energy to heat a house for an entire year. </p>

<p>After the tour a worker talked to us all about the process. He was amazing at his job, he made trash seem so interesting and had every one of us paying attention for a full hour.  In 1915 Sweden was one of the poorest countries and today it is one of the richest. This is because Sweden was neutral during WW2, while all of Europe was in turmoil Sweden was able to develop industry to provide for them. One of our tour guides questions to us was how is an egg made. Most people answered like the first image, but the real answer is the second image. Different visuals like this really helped tie in the concepts we have been learning about in lecture such as lifetime analysis. </p>

<p>After Sysav we went to visit a community called Western Harbor in Malmö. Western Harbor is a sustainable community that was built on top of an old shipyard. About 50 years ago Sweden was one of the leading ship producers, however after big oil in the 1970s Sweden could not keep up in this market. They were left with a massive shipyard that could no longer be used. In 2001 they began to transform this into an urban community. This community tries to have zero effect on its environment and is very futuristic. One of the really cool things is they have a system of underground tubes that you but your trash in and your trash is all sucked to one place… this sounds a lot like Zenon to me. </p>

<p> This is one of the most famous buildings in Sweden and is known as The Turning Torso, designed by a famous Spanish architect. </p>

<p> After our tours we went to a nice dinner Salt & Brygga and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. </p>

<p> After dinner some of us tried to go out but it was kind of a bust. Nothing much was going on in the downtown. We got to enjoy some art while walking the streets. </p>

<p> When we tried to go home the train station was pitch black and we were terrified that we were stuck in Malmö for the night. We asked a ton of people for help and typical Sweds all ignored us. Eventually a nice guy told us about a side door and we were able to get home safely. </p>
